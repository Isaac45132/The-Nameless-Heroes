#0x4A Chapter2Guide

Kara:
Oh, dear me?
Where... am I?
And who am I...?

Wrys:
Welcome, Ms. Kara.
Thank you for the joke, but you don't have to go so far as to wonder who you are.

Kara:
Hehe.

Wrys:
This is the "Guide",
which relieves a stray sheep. 

Kara:
I see, I see.
So, are you going to give me 
some hints here?

Wrys:
Exactly. You've made a good guess. 
But from the next chapter on, we'll get straight to the point.
Now I'm going on to explain this chapter... 
First, this map is
a Fog of War. 
You can see only two tiles away, so you could feel
uneasy even with the thief. 

Kara:
Jeez, I can't see any farther...
At the beginning of the chapter, Audrey said that
we'd best try and stay grouped up while making our way.
We should do as she says.

Wrys:
Almost all the enemies here don't start moving 
until you are within their range.
So, if you go too fast, you will get killed 
by many enemies rolling in. 
Among them are dark mages, and 
even Mr. Isaac can be defeated by them
in an instant.

Kara:
Yeah, Commander is very weak
in his Resistance.

Wrys:
Well, when you advance from the center to the right, 
reinforcements come on the central island.
After you come in, they appear three times separately,
so be careful.
Anyway, there won't be any problem 
unless you are going ahead too fast.

Kara:
Ahh!
There's a ballista in this chapter, too!

Wrys:
Yes. It is set in order to prevent you from
giving Mr. Isaac a ride through the central island 
and finishing the chapter too quickly.
As the proverb says, make haste slowly.
The ballista doesn't move, 
so you can deal with it well.
Now the "Guide" this time is done.
Is all right with you?

Kara:
Oh!
Wait, wait! Mr. Wrys!

Wrys:
Yes?

Kara:
Won't there be any, what is called, Jagen   
in our team?

Wrys:
Hm...?
You have already got one, haven't you? 

Kara:
Huh?
Have we?

Wrys:
You know,
it's Mr. Isaac.
It's difficult for him to get a lot of experience points,
but he can reduce enemies' HP or just drop enemies
in order to get some.   
He has high growth rates, so it's better for you 
to grow him to a certain extent.

Kara:
Oh, I didn't know... 
that Commander is of a promoted class...

Wrys:
Well, that's all.
