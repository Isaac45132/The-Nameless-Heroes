Chloe:
I have come here because 
I was told to, but...?

Wolf:
Yo! Chloe!
Ya have kept me waiting so long!

Chloe:
Hm...
You're... Mr. Wolf.

Wolf:
Nope... I, this man here
isn't Mr. Wolf.

Chloe:
??
Yes..., you are Mr. Wolf...

Wolf:
No, I'm not, Chloe.
Look, this is the "Guide", which gives you hints.
Here ya should call me "Mysterious Best Mercenary, Knight and Tactician on the Continent",
OK?

Chloe:
I don't understand your point...
Anyway, I don't much care. 
Well, Sir "Mysterious Best Mercenary, Knight and Tactician on the Continent",
please start the "Guide" of this chapter.

Wolf:
Alright, leave it to me.
First, the purpose of the chapter is defense,
with the turn number limit.
But if ya defeat the boss, the chapter ends
on the instant.

Chloe:
The enemies are near to us,
and there're many of them... 
At the beginning, we should keep back  
in order not to be attacked on all sides.

Wolf:
In addition, ya must be careful not to defeat too many enemies during their turn, 
which might result in yer being killed. 
Especially, ya had better beware of the Soldiers,
who make suicidal attacks.
Then, at the fourth turn,
a ship appears in the space at the bottom, 
with a bridge to our ship.
Of course, enemies also come
from that ship.
Deal with them anyhow.

Chloe:
What about that...?
The Priest at the left bottom
has the range which fails to 
reach our ship...

Wolf:
Oh, ya won't be within his range
unless ya go out of our ship.
There isn't any enemy around him,
so ya can rob him if ya have a chance.

Chloe:
If we do, we can take advantage.

Wolf:
Finally, I'll tell ya about the boss.
To beat that nasty slit-eyed guy, 
ya must advance toward him fast,
or you'll run out of time.
Besides, he starts to move under a certain circumstance.
As he has high abilities, ya should
be careful not to be easily beaten by him. 

Chloe:
Now I see the points.
Thank you, Sir "Mysterious Best Mercenary, Knight and Tactician on the Continent"

Wolf:
Hehe, 
nah, it's nothing.
Now it's time for ya'll to go and try!
