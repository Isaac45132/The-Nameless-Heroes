#0x48 Chapter1Guide

Breguet:
Tsk, it's a cheap-ass town.

Offscreen:
...

Breguet:
Hmph?
Who the fuck are you!?

Isaac:
I've found you hiding here.
Sorry, here this chapter finishes.

Breguet:
W, wait!
This is the "Guide" of the game...
where you're given hints! 
If you wanna beat me,
come after you go through the proper procedures. 

Isaac:
...Fine.
So, is it you that give us the hint this time?

Breguet:
Bahaha! That's right.
Be all ears, man! 
First, the goal of this chapter is tough,
because it's to defeat the boss, ME. 

Isaac:
...... I get it.
I have a question.
Are those pirates going to attack the houses?

Breguet:
Huh, no way! All the houses are supposed
to have already been looted.

Isaac:
...If so, that's OK.

Breguet:
I'll go on, lad?
There's a "damaged wall" in the chapter.
You can take a shortcut if you break it...
but soon you'll be in the ballista's range. 
Mt: 10, Hit: 70, Rng: 10.
You see it's strengthened? Be careful.
Also, when you've entered the ballista's range,
the wyvern rider will begin moving.
This fellow is troublesome.
You'd best distract 'im well.

Isaac:
The ballista and the wyvern rider...
They're both troublesome.
Especially, the ballista is dangerous.
We should send someone strong enough to hold out against its attacks 
and make it out of ammo. 

Breguet:
Wish ya good luck, lad.
Besides, when you come between the pub and the ship,
reinforcements appear around me.
You've gotta deal with 'em without being rushed, man?
Finally, I, the boss, move.
I don't have any weapon for indirect attacks, but I'm fast in AS.  
If ya make light of me, you'll get terribly hurt.

Isaac:
Hm, now I think I've got enough information...
We'll soon see you there. Wait awhile. 

Breguet
Gee, that guy scares me.
