テキストID 8CD     序章会話１

Kara:
Hey! Commander!
Commander, heyyy!
Do you hear me?
Hellooo?

Issac:
...
.....
..........!
Oh, Sorry.
What did you want to talk about?

Kara:
Jeez!
You qualifying me as a full-fledged pegasus knight,
that's what I want to talk about!
You saw, didn't you?
How I've been doing so well in battle recently?!

Isaac:
I admit you're working hard,
but I can't qualify a novice like you.

Kara:
What?! Why not?!
You've often complimented my skills
recently, haven't you, Commander?

Isaac:
I only compliment you so you can do better.
But you'd best not get carried away.

Kara:
Tsk...

Isaac:
Audrey, say something to her.

Audrey:
Kara, Isaac can qualify
you for a full-fledged pegasus knight
and send you back to Ilia right away.
Why do you think he doesn't do that?

Kara:
Because he doesn't want to let me go?

Olson:
She's an idiot,
as always...

Kara:
Jeez! You're all so mean!

------------------------------------------------------(Insertion Begins)

Edmund:
Now, now, everybody.
Don't tease her.
Kara has been working hard. I assure you, Family.

Kara:
Ohhh, Sirrr Ed...

Audrey:
Ed, don't spoil her.
------------------------------------------------------(Insertion Ends)
On the battlefield, one aims at the easiest target.
Kara, if we let you back while you're still a novice,
you'll end up being killed before long.
Isaac can't 
help being anxious about you.
So that you aren't killed after you return to Ilia,
he wants you to leave when you are experienced enough.
Do you understand, Kara?

Isaac:
Audrey, 
don't say such unnecessary things.

Morris:
Sir Commander is so thoughtful.
Kara, you are quite blessed.
When I was a new recruit, it was...
...?
Hmm, it seems
rather noisy outside, doesn't it?

Kara:
Ah! I wonder if it's an entertainer or something.
I like entertainers!
Hey, can I go and see?

Morris:
Wait, Kara.
Just listen to us before going.

Kara:
Um, umm...
But you talk so long...

Isaac:
...That's strange.
I never heard of any events being planned.

■ Part 4 0x8CB

Isaac:
...The enemies are invading 
faster than I thought.
Ed, Audrey and I take on the front line.     ←(ADDITION!!)
Olson and Morris support us
from the back.
Kara, you focus on reporting
the enemies’ information to us quickly.
Do be careful not to
rush to the front line.

Kara:
Jeez! I’ll do all well before you tell me 
to do this and that!

Isaac:
Morris,
have you learnt to use staves at last?

Morris:
Yes, sir. Leave it to me.
I finally got the knack recently.
When someone is hurt, it’s my turn.

Isaac:
Olson, 
is your tome still usable?

Olson:
I bought a new one some time ago.
It’s as good as brand-new.

---------------------------------------(Insertion Begins)
Edmund:
Alright, Family. I assure you
I’ll protect you all.

---------------------------------------(Insertion Ends)

Audrey:
Isaac, my axes seem 
to be still all right. 

Isaac:
No problem, right? 
Listen, we now
don’t have enough supplies.
But by capturing enemies,  
we can supply ourselves.
Try to find and capture weakend ones 
and get supplies.  
Now, we rout bandits.
Here we go!

Edmund:
Hey, Olson?

Olson:
Hm, Ed.
You look rather cheerful, huh?

Edmund:
I do. Ta-dah!
Shall we eat these together?

Olson:
Hm? Those look like expensive 
baked sweets.
But did you buy them for yourself, didn’t you?
I’m afraid you should enjoy them alone.

Edmund:
This kind of things taste best
when we share them together, Family! 
Now, help yourself to whatever you like!

Olson:
If you insist, I will.
Well, let’s see...
