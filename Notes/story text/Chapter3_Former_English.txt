Chapter 3 English  Opening 1 ID 94B

Captain: If we keep the ship sailing smoothly as we do, we got about half a day left to go.
Issac: I'm sorry, Captain. Having your boat sailed right into pirate territory must have been pretty risky.
Captain: It's fine. With pirates roaming around, business is pretty much nonexistent. Also, the people of this town says they'll help us, so we must do what we can.
Issac: Glad you say so, but there comes…
Captain: What's wrong?
Issac: It's a ship, Captain. It's trying to come alongside us.
Captain: Shit, they've approached us hiding in this fog. Huh… it seems to bear Etrurian colors. Is it a patrol ship? The biggest conundrum is what they want from us.

Opening 2 ID 93B
Schwarz: This is a patrol ship of the Kingdom of Etruria. Stop the ship, and bring your captain to me.

Opening 3 ID 928
Captain: Apparently, they're calling me. Anyway, it's not a big deal. Wait in the ship. I'll deal with this hassle.
Issac: Captain? Is this a common occurrence?
Captain: No… this is the first time. The whole continent is in turmoil these days so I guess the Etrurian guards are being a bit harsher. This misunderstanding should be cleared up pretty quickly.
Issac:…

Opening 4 ID 928
Captain: I'm the captain here. What's the problem, officer?
Schwarz: My name is Schwarz and I am the chief of the Etrurian guards. Could I investigate the ship, please?
Captain: Wh, why, sir? What the hell are we suspected of?
Schwarz: I agree that this is certainly sudden, so I'm sorry. In fact, we overheard news that pirates are lurking in this neighbourhood, so we're investigating. I wonder if you could let us.
Captain: Huh, sir…? You think we look like “pirates”?
Schwarz: I'm just making sure. Pirates these days are very smart when it comes to disguises.
Captain: If that's the case…, that sounds reasonable.
Schwarz: Thank you for your cooperation. Alright, everyone, I got permission. Men, bring all the cargo of their ship into ours!
Soldier: Yes sir! We'll go and get everything ready.
Captain:Oh... please, wait just a little. I've never heard Etrurian guards do such things!
Schwarz: We'll only take the cargo back to base and investigate it. When it comes to an investigation, we must make a thorough one. Or, do you have anything shady behind your back?
Captain: That's not it… But if you take all this cargo away, our business'll get stalled.
Soldier: Mr. Schwarz, we're ready.
Schwarz: Good. Do it. 
Soldier: Ay, sir.
Captain: Hey! All of you! Stop doing that! Don't ruin our ship!
Schwarz: …? What's up? What is going on with your hands?
Captain: What?
Schwarz: Don't touch me with your dirty, commoner hands!
Captain: !!
Schwarz: This act can be seen as a sign of rebellion against the Etrurians!
Captain: No, don't be silly! I only touched you for a moment!
Schwarz: So… you rebels… deserve punishment, right?
Captain: Hey! Calm dow…

Opening 5 ID 94D
Issac: !! …This is starting to get troublesome.

Opening 6 ID 94E
Issac: Captain! Are you OK?
Schwarz: Well, well, who are you people? You seem to be a group of mercenaries or something, but… That ship is property of the rebels. We must confiscate it, so you must all vacate the boat!
Issac: This is the middle of the ocean. Besides, a lot of civilians are below decks, so where are you telling us to go?
Schwarz: Into the water, of course. We'll help you do it. Now you should gather everyone here on the deck.
Issac: …Sorry, but that offer is an option we can't take. 
Schwarz: Well… We are doing this while bearing the mantle of “justice”. So you are now disturbing justice, in which case I cannot overlook that refusal as a “knight”.
Issac: But how is it, that you, a knight, would find fault with the captain, commandeer the ship and take the supplies? That almost seems like something a “pirate” would do.
Schwarz: You treat us as “pirates”…?
Issac: And as a “pirate”, you seem honored with a very fine flag.
Schwarz: You… lowly mercenaries…! Soldiers, kill those bastards! Get ready to kill everyone on that ship! It's a grave crime to insult me, no, us Etrurian knights. Your death shall not be quick!

Opening 7 ID 92E
Seaman: Captain! Hey, mercenaries, we'll take care of Captain. So will you keep them from coming into our ship? 
Issac: Understood. But I too have something to ask of you, professional seaman.
Seaman: We specialize only in transportation. However, I'll listen to you at least.
Issac: Is it possible to pierce the enemy's command ship? Unless some trouble happens, the enemy won't withdraw. We can't keep fighting forever. Can you make it?
Captain: We can…
Seaman: Captain! Please don't overdo it, you're still injured!
Captain: Ya… idiot… Now's … the time… to … overdo it. You…explain.
Seaman: Y, yup… We are sailors. We know everything about most ships. So, we can secretly attack the command ship and burst a hole that causes it to sink.
Issac: Alright, we'll keep them distracted up top as long as possible.
Seaman: I'll leave it to ya… Now, let's retreat, Captain!

Rem appears on turn 4! ID 950
Rem: Oh, hurray! At last, there's a chance for me to escape! Hell, I successfully stole into this ship, but since it set sail, I've been in trouble. Oh well, time to evacuate!

Rem and Issac's conversation ID A71
Issac: Hey you! Why'd you escape from the Etrurian ship?
Rem: Gee, I was seen… I'll pass myself off anyhow… In fact, sir…, I was caught by the people on the ship… I've barely escaped with my life…sniff.
Issac: That claim sounds made up. You must be trying to hide it, but I see you're holding some valuable objects. So the story is like this; you stole into the Etrurian ship to snitch things, but unfortunately, you were unable to break out of it, right?
Rem: S, so what! I'm barely getting by! Yup, I do steal, but I can't afford to care about whatever I do!
Issac: That attitude is passable, but only for a time. And the end of that time will certainly come, when you must change your way of life. It's not now, though. You're lucky this time.
Rem:…
Issac: Come on, get out of here, before you're involved.
Rem: Hey, can I stay with you? Are you laddies mercenaries, aren't you? Since you preach about changing ways of life so much, how about you gimme the opportunity to change my way? Or I'll follow you around. 
Isaac: Do you understand what this situation is like, don't you?
Rem: Of course I do. And it's no obstacle. 
Issac: Very well. I will let you in, in consideration of your guts. But can you listen to orders and act obediently?
Rem: Huh, I'd be glad to!

Brian and Rem conversation ID A73
Brian: Hmm? That girl looks like …?
Rem: Hey you! Could you please get outta my way, lad!? As you see, I'm barely escaping with my life! 
Brian: Oops, sorry. You can go that way. Hurry up, kid.
Rem: ‘'Thanks'', sir.
Brian: Hey, little girl, wait a second!
Rem: What? Don't you see I'm in a hurry?
Brian: I do see you were holding some pretty expensive looking stuff. You're a thief, right?  
Rem: Hey, those are mine! Give them back!
Brian: Yeah, yeah, better give it back… 
Rem: Hmph!
Brian: Here's a piece of advice, one thief to the other. Stop pickpocketing, or you'll soon find yourself in between a rock and a hard place.
Rem: You, a thief, telling me to stop thieving? You've gotta practice what you preach! Where's yer boss? I've gotta complain about you, or I cannot settle down! 
Brian: Wait, kid! Don't go that way! They're having severe fighting over there.
Rem: Shut up, you preachy old man!

Schwarz boss dialogue ID904
Schwarz: What an annoyance. My armor will get dirty… with your blood!

Schwarz vs. Isaac dialogue ID91A
Schwarz : Considering you're a lowly mercenary, your armor looks refined. In addition, your sword technique… It's Etrurian!
Isaac: And what?
Schwarz: You're pitiful…! Chuckle. You… must have been a noble! Unable to maintain your clan, you degraded yourself to a mercenary! I can't find any other way to call you,“pitiful” man!
Isaac: I'm not going to join you in stalling for time. 
Schwarz: Chuckle… For the honor of Etruria, a pitiful man like you shall die by my hand!
Isaac: I'll see you try!

Schwarz death quote ID 90D
Schwarz: Now, I get it… That black armor… You dirty, Etruscan minions… “Nameless”…

Chapter 3 ending cut scene
Schwarz: Tsk… These lowly mercenaries are troublesome.
Soldier: Commander Schwarz! The enemy has blown a hole in the hull of our ship! If we continue this battle, we'll sink!
Schwarz: When in the world did they do such a thing…? Humiliated by a bunch of lowly mercenaries… But we can't help it. Men! We'll stop fighting and leave now!
Soldier: Yes, sir!
Schwarz: Dammit! Shit! When we meet next, mercenaries… I'll surely… !

Chapter 3 ending 2
Isaac: Hear me, soldiers! Your general is defeated, so this fight is now pointless! Drop your weapons and surrender, and I will guarantee that your life will not be taken!
