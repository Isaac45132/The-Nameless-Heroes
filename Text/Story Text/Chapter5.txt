#0x989 Chapter5Opening1

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
We're almost[N]
at the exit...[AN]

[MidRight][LoadGreenSoldier]
That's right.[AN]
But the Etrurians are gathering[N]
soldiers to prevent our escape.[AN]
There aren't many, but they're[N]
Etrurian soldiers all the same.[AN]
Don't be off your guard.[AN]

[MidLeft]
In order to survive, we just need[N]
to remove the obstacles ahead.[AN]
According to your instructions,[AN]
we're heading east from the mine,[N]
then escaping by ship. Right?[AN]

[MidRight]
Correct.[AN]
The rioters will boarded and[N]
sent back to whence they came.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's a relief.[AN]
What happens to them[N]
if we screw this up?[AN]

[MidRight]
We're not that dishonorable.[N]
When we do a job, we do it right.[AN]
By the way, which island are[N]
you and your mercenaries from?[AN]
I don't imagine it's this one.[AN]

[MidLeft]
We're not from the islands.[AN]
We happened to be working in Dia[N]
and were transported here by force.[AN]

[MidRight]
That must have been terrible.[N]
I say this for your own safety -[AN]
Get out of the Western Isles[N]
as soon as you get the chance.[AN]
As you could tell, those Etrurians[N]
view us as nothing more than slaves.[AN]
If you refuse their demands,[AN]
they'll execute you, burn down[N]
your home... you get the idea.[AN]
Sticking around here only[N]
serves to invite disaster.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, I'll[N]
think it over.[AN]

[MidRight]
That would be wise.[AN]
Looks like we're[N]
just about there.[AN]
Brace yourself.[A][2X][X]





#0x97E Chapter5Opening2

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][Right][LoadMoneyMan]
I can see the exit![N]
We're almost there, guys![AN]

[FarRight][LoadBrownHairMan]
Finally, done with those Etrurian[N]
bastards! We won't forget this![AN]

[Right][ClearFace][LoadYoungMan]
With this momentum,[N]
we can get outta here![AN]
Let's break through[N]
that exit! Rrraaargh![AN]

[FarRight][ClearFace][LoadGingerMan]
Cough, cough...[N]
I can... go home now?[AN]
[Right][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]

[MidRight][LoadAudrey]
With this much force,[N]
there's no stopping us now.[AN]
Isaac, have you decided on[N]
our next course of action?[AN]
Surely after this we can't[N]
stay on the isles any longer.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't be too hasty.[AN]
We aren't out of[N]
the water just yet.[AN]

[MidRight]
Sorry, Isaac.[N]
You're right.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Though, that Resistance soldier said[N]
we should get away from the islands.[AN]

[MidRight]
What do you think?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Our work isn't exactly easy.[AN]
This island isn't fit for[N]
us to make our living here.[AN]
I can say that much.[AN]

[MidRight]
I agree. I feel sorry for[N]
the Resistance, though...[A][2X][X]






#0x97F Chapter5Opening3

[MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
These escapees...[AN]
Shit, they're really[N]
gaining traction...[AN]
But their advance[N]
will be stopped here.[AN]
Listen up! If you forfeit,[N]
we'll reduce your sentence![AN]
Any further advance will[N]
be met with execution![AN]
You will not defeat us![N]
Make your decision now![A][2X][X]




#0x980 Chapter5Opening4

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
So they say.[AN]

[Right][LoadCaptain]
Grah! You morons![AN]
You think we're gonna[N]
accept those terms?![AN]
Crawl back into the[N]
hole you came from![AN]

[FarRight][LoadPirate]
Kill them![AN]
Don't stop until we kill[N]
every last one of them![AN]

[Right]
Yeah! Let's go![N]
We're almost free![AN]
Those damned guards[N]
can't stop us![A][2X][X]




#0x97C Chapter5Opening5

[MidRight][LoadRedSoldier][MidLeft][LoadDenny]
Damnit, give me a report![N]
What the hell is going on?[AN]


[MidRight]
Yes, sir! Eberacum's[N]
inamates staged a breakout...[AN]
Some of our soldiers have been[N]
drugged with sleeping powder.[AN]
The troops gathered here[N]
are all we have available.[AN]
Jutes sent us a message that[N]
they will send reinforcements...[AN]
But there's no way they will[N]
arrive here in time to help.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Outrageous![AN]
Etruria's honor will be sullied[N]
by this... this insurrection![AN]
What of my other generals?![AN]

[MidRight]
We've recieved no reply...[N]
They're presumed dead, sir.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmph, how pathetic.[N]
Alright men, defensive position![AN]
At all costs, we hold out[N]
until reinforcements arrive![A][2X][X]






#0x982 Chapter5Opening6

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Seems they're moving[N]
in tight groups.[AN]
Alright, let's try[N]
to focus our attacks![A][2X][X]






#0x98A Chapter5Ending1

[MidRight][LoadGreenSoldier][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
All right, we've[N]
broken through.[AN]

[MidRight]
Seems our plan worked.[AN]
From here, we move to[N]
the coast on the southeast.[AN]
We, the Resistance,[N]
will lead you there.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I hear the ship is waiting there.[AN]
So far, things have gone well.[N]
Let's hope our luck keeps up.[AN]

[MidRight]
The nearby fortresses are sure[N]
to be sending troops our way.[AN]
We need to move quickly.[AN]
Come what may, we must reach[N]
the coast before they arrive.[AN]
Would you be able to guard[N]
us as we escort the prisoners?[AN]
While we'd like to assist you in[N]
combat, they are top priority.[AN]
Any objections?[AN]

[MidLeft]
None from me.[AN]
Though I'm not exactly[N]
keen on dying just yet.[AN]
We'll withdraw when it[N]
becomes too much for us.[AN]

[MidRight]
Right. Just make sure[N]
to guard us until then.[AN]
We'll be counting[N]
on your assistance.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Understood.[A][2X][X]






#0x971 Chapter5Ending2

[MidRight][LoadGreenSoldier][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
By the way, I never[N]
asked your boss's name.[AN]
I'm told they call her[N]
"The Hero of the West".[AN]

[MidRight]
Her name is Echidna.[AN]
And it's thanks to her we[N]
stand a fighting chance at all.[AN]
She's the heart of the Resistance.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sounds like one[N]
hell of a person.[AN]

[MidRight]
We don't know her[N]
very well personally.[AN]
She came to us out of[N]
nowhere to guide us.[AN]
That's why she has[N]
such a nickname.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Is it possible to[N]
meet Echidna in person?[AN]
I want to thank her[N]
for helping us out.[AN]

[MidRight]
Echidna should be on[N]
the coast waiting for us.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Looks like we'll have to[N]
get through this one too, then.[AN]
What is she like, I wonder...[A][2X][X]





#0xF12 Chapter5AreaEvent

[MidLeft][LoadDenny]
Looks like they've arrived.[AN]
Platoons, on your ready![N]
We must stop these criminals![A][2X][X]





#0x97A Chapter5VSDenny

[MidLeft][LoadDenny]
You damned runaways![N]
Stop at once![AN]
Looks like it's up to me...[N]
I shall stop you myself![A][2X][X]





#0x981 Chapter5DennyDeath

[MidLeft][LoadDenny]
No way...[N]
This isn't...[AN]
How this should end...[A][CloseEyes][.....][2X][X]




#0x5B Chapter5Guide


[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadWrys]
Welcome, Sir Isaac.[N]
This is the Guide Corner...[AN]

[MidRight]
Listen, old man.[N]
I get it already.[AN]
You've explained[N]
it every single time.[AN]
I'm sure everyone else[N]
has figured it out, too.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You never know, there might be someone[N]
seeing the guide for the first time.[AN]
They might not understand otherwise.[AN]

[MidRight]
I guess you're right.[N]
Go ahead and start over.[AN]

[MidLeft]
[Beat][AN]
Thank you for understanding.[N]
Well, back from the top.[AN]
This is the Guide Corner,[N]
where I will give advice.[AN]

[MidRight]
Advice, huh. So, you'll[N]
tell me about my mission?[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's right, Sir Isaac.[AN]
Well then, before I explain that,[N]
let's talk about mastery skills.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, I have one of those.[AN]
I still haven't seen[N]
it in action, though.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's because mastery skills[N]
can only trigger at [Red]weapon level S.[Red][AN]
That means that warrior can't[N]
trigger his skill against you.[AN]

[MidRight]
That's a relief to hear.[AN]
But that means I can't[N]
quite use mine yet, huh.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Exactly. Your skill, Sol, is very[N]
useful, but only once you can use it.[AN]

[MidRight]
...Well, that makes[N]
sense, doesn't it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Back to your mission this time...[AN]
There's no restriction on your time[N]
here, so feel free to move leisurely.[AN]
There seems to be a lot of enemies[N]
with valuable weapons, so...[AN]

[MidRight]
I know. If we can capture them,[N]
we'll be better off down the road.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right you are.[AN]
But be careful not to get too[N]
carried away, lest you get taken down.[AN]
Next, on the [Red]eighth round, [Red]two thieves[N]
will try to escape from the upper left.[AN]
If you can catch them, you may[N]
find it rather... rewarding.[AN]

[MidRight]
I'll have to move quickly[N]
to catch up to them, then.[AN]

[MidLeft]
It's easy to die if you move forwards[N]
recklessly, so move with caution.[AN]
That should conclude your briefing.[AN]

[MidRight]
See you next time.[A][2X][X]
