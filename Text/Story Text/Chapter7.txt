Tell me, Geese.[AN]
You're sure that[N]
this is alright?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, don't worry 'bout it.[AN]
Ya've already been a big help[N]
boardin' the cargo, and all that.[AN]
Not much more ta go either,[N]
by the looks of things at least.[AN]

[MidRight]
[CloseEyes]Thank god.[AN][OpenEyes]
We've been moving[N]

Looks like the end's[N]
finally in sight.[AN]

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Gahahahaha![AN]
Well, since I'm real[N]
grateful for yer help,[AN]
why don't we help[N]
ourselves to a drink?[AN]
Sound good?[AN][ToggleSmile]

[MidRight]
That does sounds good.[N]
I'll come with you.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Arr, now yer talkin'![AN]
On Port Russel here,[N]
there's a huge tavern.[AN]
They offer the finest[N]

Also, if ya come at the[N]

[MidLeft][LoadPirate][MidRight][LoadGeese]
What's the matter?[N]
Somethin' wrong?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ye... yes, Captain![AN]
It seems someone[N]
wants to see you...[AN]

[MidRight]
Lookin' fer me, huh?[AN]
I don't remember plannin'[N]
anything like that here...[AN]
But even then... what's[N]
gotten ya all shook up, lad?[AN]

[MidLeft]
W-well, if my eyes are[N]
still workin' proper...[AN]
I'd say that hooded one[N]
is an Etrurian noble...[AN]

[MidRight]
...Couldn't be.[AN]
Why would he be lookin'[N]
fer mock pirates like us?[AN]
Ya trying ta say he's here[N]
to arrest us firsthand?[AN]

[MidLeft]
If that were true, I think we'd[N]
have already been taken in...[AN]
I'm not sure 'bout the reason,[N]
but they're saying they want you.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alright, alright.[N]
I'll humor 'im.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Let's go,[N]
Captain![AN]
This way![AN]

[Clear][MidRight][Clear][MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadGeese]
Looks like I'm going[N]
fer a bit, then.[AN]

[MidRight]
...This gives me[N]
a bad feeling.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hah, well, we haven't done[N]
anythin' illegal. Not yet![AN]
So we should be jus' fine.[N]
You lot can take a break.[AN]
Oh, be a pal and look[N]
after the cargo for me.[AN]
Wouldn't do to have it[N]
stolen after all that, eh?[AN]

[MidRight]
Roger that.[N]
Take care.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Alright![N]
Thanks, mate![A][2X][X]

Looks like you're[N]
still in one piece.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Haha, guess so...[N]
Somehow, anyways...[AN]

[MidRight]
...Huh?[N]
Anything wrong?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hm, nah... I'm not[N]
sure what ta say...[AN]
I can at least say[N]
it's kinda troublin'...[AN]
But, I can't tell[N]
ya in good detail.[AN]
And, sorry, but we're[N]
going to a Fibernian port,[AN]
Deil, after we drop off[N]
the cargo real quickly.[AN]
After that, I'll take[N]
ya to a nice tavern,[AN]
and then yer destination.[AN]
I'm real sorry about this.[N]
Can you work with that?[AN]

[MidRight]
I can see it's[N]
something important.[AN]
You've helped[N]
us out quite a bit.[AN]
I don't mind if you[N]
take the detour, Geese.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sorry again, mate.[N]
Thank ya so much![AN]
I'll pay ya for[N]
yer protection too.[AN]

[MidRight]
...Suspicious.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, come on, lad![N]
Please don't be so cautious![AN]
We're just sailin' as usual.[AN]
Anyway, let's make haste[N]
and drop off the cargo.[AN]
We put out to sea as[N]
soon as we're all done![A][2X][X]




#0x8D5 Chapter7Opening4

[MidLeft][LoadGeese][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
So, that Etrurian noble asked you[N]
to escort those entertainers?[AN]
Seems very hospitable.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ya think?[AN]
Well, entartainers sponsored by[N]
nobles are usually with knights,[AN]
for their protection.[AN]
If some noble likes 'em,[N]
they're treated with hospitality.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hospitable enough to come[N]
ask you in person, right?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ya might be[N]
onto somthing'...[A][2X][X]

I feel sick...[AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Are you OK?[AN]
Should I bring[N]
you something...?[AN]
[ClearSpeech]

[FarFarLeft]
Yes, please...[N]
I'm sorry...[AN]
I... I'm going[N]
to lie down...[AN]
Urgh...[AN]
[ClearSpeech]

[MidLeft][LoadGeese][MidRight]
That... is the entertainer[N]
sponsored by that noble...[AN]
Looks are decieving, it seems.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ya can never tell from lookin'[N]
whether they can perform or not.[AN]
There's another fella, a bard,[N]
and he was a pretty polite guy.[AN]
He didn't look too well either,[AN]
but he at least took the time[N]
to come and say thanks to me.[AN]

[MidRight]
Sponsored by a noble...[N]
She's of a high standard.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well, if you're interested,[N]
I can try asking 'em a favor.[AN]
Make it up to ya' fer what[N]
happened the other day, eh?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, that sounds nice.[N]
I'd appreciate it, Geese.[AN]
[Event]

[FarFarRight]
Captain!![N]
Oh, no! Captain!![AN]
Pirates! Looks like Zot's crew[N]
have started gaining on us![AN]

[MidLeft]
What the hell?![N]
Oh, for the love of...[AN]
There couldn't be a worse[N]
time for them to show up![AN]
Can't we pull away!?[AN]

[FarFarRight]
We can't, Captain![N]
They're much faster![AN]

[MidRight]
Looks like it's[N]
our turn, then.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sorry... I didn't[N]
think this'd happen...[AN]
Zot's pirates are[N]
based around this area.[AN]
I thought we were[N]
far enough away, but...[AN]

[FarFarRight]

They're gonna ram us![AN]

Gah... [.....]Is...[.....][N]
Is everyone alright?[AN]
Has... anyone been[N]
thrown overboard?[AN]

[Right]
Looks like we're okay, by[N]
the skin of our teeth...[AN]
We wouldn't have been if[N]
you didn't call it out, though.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thank the stars...[AN]
How about my crew?[N]
Is everybody safe?![AN]

[FarRight]
Y-Yes, Captain...[N]
Seems everyone is safe...[AN]
But look, Captain![AN]
It looks like they're[N]
going to climb onboard![AN]
And they're aimin' that[N]
ballista right for us...[AN]
Seems we're gonna be...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Calm down![N]
We're mariners![AN]
We can handle this.[AN]

[FarRight]
C-Captain...![N]
You're right.[AN]

[MidLeft]
We have no choice[N]
but to fight back...[AN]
But unluckily for them,[AN]
we've got our mercenary[N]
friends on our side![AN]
I'm countin' on ya, lads![AN]

[Right]
Let's do it.[N]
You handle the boat.[AN]
And look after[N]
our guests, too.[AN]

[MidLeft]

Get the weapons[N]

Gahaha! I'll be damned...![N]
They're hightailin' it![AN]
It's all thanks to ya, lad![AN]

[MidLeft]
Nonsense. We wouldn't have made[N]
it without you and your crew.[AN]

[MidRight]
Ha! Don't be so humble![AN]
I saw how you guys were fighting[N]
and it really got me blood pumpin'![AN]
Zot's blasted crew scurried off![N]
That feels mighty good...[AN]
Usually we're the ones runnin'![N]
Cravens! Serves 'em right![AN]

[MidLeft]
By the way...[AN]
Are the ship and the[N]
entertainers all right?[AN]

[MidRight]
Ay, both are[N]
in good shape![AN]

[FarFarLeft]
H-hey...[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, speak of the devil...[AN]
I need to do some checks on the big[N]

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][FarRight][LoadLarum][Right][LoadLizzy]
We are safe, too,[N]
thanks to you.[AN]
Thank you very much.[AN]

[FarRight]
Whew! I was worried our[N]
trip was gonna end there![AN]

[MidLeft]
Likewise, we're safe thanks[N]
to both of your help. Thank you.[AN]
So, I've heard you entertainers[N]
have to travel with protection.[AN]
I imagine it's tough to get by[N]
in... in times like these.[AN]

[FarRight]
It is! We're so good that people[N]
are out to get us for themselves.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sorry to be a bother, Ms. Larum.[AN]
But if you don't mind, would you[N]
put on a dance for my mercenaries?[AN]
Many of them are wanting to see.[N]
I won't you force you, though.[AN]

[FarRight]
Heehee, don't worry about it.[AN]
After all, if I refused, what[N]
kind of dancer would I be...?[AN]
You really helped us out, so I'll[N]
give you all an extra special dance![AN]
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need[N]
to go and get ready! Heehee...[AN]
[ClearSpeech][MoveFarLeft][Clear][FarLeft][LoadLarum][MoveFarRight][Clear]

[MidLeft]
...Is she always[N]
like... that?[AN]

[Right]
Hahaha...[N]
Kind of...[AN]

[MidLeft]
You're... Ms. Lizzy, right?[N]
Thank you for your help, too.[AN]

[Right]
Likewise![N]
But, um, I have a question.[AN]
Your swordplay... it's the same[N]
as the Etrurian knight's, isn't it?[AN]
Were you... a knight, once...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Something like that.[AN]
Sorry, but I can't[N]
say more than that.[AN]

[Right]
Oh, no, I'm sorry.[AN]
I should introduce[N]
myself properly.[AN]
My name is Lizzy.[AN]
I'm an Etrurian knight,[N]
and despite my looks,[AN]
I'm an officer too.[AN]
I'm still something of[N]
a novice though, ahaha...[AN]

[MidLeft]
You fought bravely, miss.[AN]
I'm confident you'll[N]
grow into a fine officer.[AN]

[Right]
Oh, thank you, sir![N]
I'll work hard at it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I've met someone like you before...[N]
He was an admirable knight.[AN]
Like a hero in some fairy tale...[N]
a true knight in shining armor.[AN]
I hope you can turn out like him.[AN]

[Right][HalfCloseEyes][Beat][AN]
Well...[N]
Um...[AN][OpenEyes]

[MidLeft]
Is something the matter?[AN]

[Right]
Do you... do you[N]
know his name?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sure. His[N]
name was Liam.[AN]

[Right]
O-Oh, my... Liam...[N]
He was my brother.[AN]
Um... I never thought I'd[N]
hear my brother's name here.[AN]

[MidLeft][TMM][CloseEyes]
...![.....][AN]
[TMM][OpenEyes]

[Right]
I don't know if you'd heard,[N]
but Liam was killed in battle.[AN]
He was stopping by a village,[N]
and it was attacked by bandits.[AN]
I think he struggled desperately[N]
to protect the people there.[AN]
His armor was worn, and I know[N]
he always kept it pristine.[AN]
...I'm happy that I could meet[N]
someone who knew my brother.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Um...[AN]

[Right]
Oh, I'm sorry![N]
We only just met,[AN]
and here I am telling[N]
you such a gloomy story...[AN]

[MidLeft]
No, I should be the one[N]
to say sorry. I had no idea.[AN]

[Right]
Nono, please don't worry about it![AN]
Our family lineage is one of knights,[N]
so we're used to death in the family.[AN]
Though, now that I'm the only child,[N]
it's a bit more pressure on me...[AN]
So, I'll have to work hard to[N]
become a brilliant knight like him![AN]
For my family, and my brother![AN]
Anyways, I should be getting[N]
back to doing my work, ahaha.[AN]
It'll only be a little while, but[N]
I'm glad we'll get to work together.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Likewise...[AN]

Are you thinking[N]
about back then?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Were you listening[N]
in on us, Audrey?[AN]

[MidRight][LoadAudrey]
Yeah, I was.[AN]
Never expected to run into[N]
someone related with that affair...[AN]
She wouldn't believe that we...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Watch it.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, sorry.[AN]

[MidLeft]
So those entertainer's[N]
protection is just her.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, I'm afraid one[N]
bodyguard isn't enough.[AN]
There must be something[N]
else going on here...[AN]
And Captain Geese[N]
seemed restless, too.[AN]
Don't you think so?[AN]

[MidLeft]
There's no point in speculating.[AN]
Let's just hope we can make it[N]

[MidRight]
This village is suspected of raiding[N]
villages from other countries nearby.[AN]
It is our mission to wipe out the bandits.[AN]
I mustn't leak this fact to other countries,[N]
which means... no one is allowed to live.[AN]

[MidLeft]
So you're Etrurian soldiers.[AN]
And... this village is a[N]
bandit stronghold, huh?[AN]
How ridiculous![N]
That's an outright lie![AN]

[MidRight]
It's not up to me[N]
nor you to judge that.[AN]
Still, I admire[N]
people like you.[AN]

[MidLeft]
What!?[AN]

[MidRight]
Running around to save these people...[AN]
You're the ideal of a knight.[N]
And yet my orders are far from that.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Then why must you continue?![N]
It's not too late to stop![AN]
You can still lower your weapons![AN]

[MidRight]
That's not an option,[N]
because this is our duty.[AN]
For the sake of Etruria...[N]
and for her people...[AN]
I steel myself as a "knight".[AN]

[MidLeft]
Obeying orders without question...[N]
How... how dare you pose as a knight![AN]

I wasn't?[AN]
Oh, well, thank you[N]
for protecting me![AN]
My name is Larum,[AN]
and I'm here to help[N]
with my famous dance![AN]

[MidLeft]
...Something tells me she's[N]
going to be a nuisance.[A][2X][X]

Hey sir, over this way![N]
Hey, old man! Here![AN]

[MidRight]
Hmm...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Jeez, you finally noticed![AN]
It may not be obvious at first,[AN]
but you're in the prescence[N]
of the great magician Artie![AN]
By comparison, you are...[N]
Argh! What's with that look?![AN]
Fine, fine, I'll cooperate![AN]

[MidRight]
Well then, miss "great magician",[N]
I'd reccommend hiding below deck.[AN]
Would you not agree with that?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ohoho! Of course I wouldn't![AN]
You, devoid of magic, simply cannot[N]
understand my supreme magical abilty![AN]
Watch closely now, and I might[N]
bless you with a taste of my power![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadWrys][MidRight][LoadYggdra]
Okay, Mr. Wrys! Let's see[N]
what tips you have this time![AN]

[MidLeft]
Very well, Miss Yggdra.[N]
Let me get right to it, then.[AN]
First of all, you should[N]
note that [Red]there is a time limit.[Red][AN]
You won't lose if you reach it,[AN]
but you may want to defeat[N]
the enemy leader for his item.[AN]

[MidRight]
So we should try and move[N]
quickly then... Duly noted.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You should also be wary[N]
of enemy reinforcements.[AN]
The enemy soldiers that appear[N]
may have powerful weaponry.[AN]
On the [Red]eighth round [Red]of combat,[AN]
the pirates from the south[N]
ship will begin boarding us.[AN]

[MidRight]
Those soldiers are[N]
a pain to deal with,[AN]
especially if they[N]
have strong weapons...[AN]
I might want to try and[N]
[Red]block them from coming.[Red][AN]

[MidLeft]
It's a good strategy.[AN]
And as long as you[N]
prepare to be boarded,[AN]
you should be able[N]
to deal with the south.[AN]
Lastly, I'll talk about[N]
the enemy's leader.[AN]

[MidRight]
A berserker...[AN]
They're both fast and strong,[N]
so we should be very careful.[AN]
Who would do best against him?[N]
Maybe we should send Isaac...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sir Isaac's Intimidate skill can [Red]negate[N]
the berserker's critical hit rate bonus.[Red][AN]
He may be your best option against him.[AN]

[MidRight]
And there's reinforcements[N]
near the boss too...[AN]
We really need to hurry[N]
if we want to defeat him.[AN]
Looks like we'll need to[N]
be smart about splitting up.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I think that about[N]
wraps it up for now.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, I think so.[N]
Until next time![A][2X][X]
