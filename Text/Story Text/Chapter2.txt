#0x880 Chapter2WorldMap

After they liberated[N]
the port town of Valetta,[AN]
Isaac and the mercenaries obtain[N]
a map leading to the pirates' base.[AN]
They got ready right away,[AN]
and looked for a ship which would[N]
take them to the pirates' island.[AN]
It was quite clear that it[N]
was a treacherous voyage,[AN]
but it turned out to be easy to find[N]
someone to offer them passage.[AN]
After a day-long voyage, the Island[N]
of Devils appeared on the horizon.[AN][Event]
It is an isolated island,[N]
covered with ominous fog.[AN]
Isaac and the others step ashore[N]
with a great degree of caution...[A][Event][2X][X]





#0x914 Chapter2Opening1
 
[MidRight][LoadAudrey][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
It looks like we're near[N]
the pirates' stronghold.[AN]

[MidRight]
No mistaking it.[AN]
Once we clear it out, the surrounding[N]
area should be safe for the time being.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I have a bad feeling[N]
about this place.[AN]
The fog is so thick, we[N]
can't even send a scout...[AN]
At least this map gives me[N]
a good idea of the terrain.[AN]
But I think we should[N]
advance with great caution.[A]

[MidRight]
For everyone's safety, I think it's[N]
best that we try and stay grouped up.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Agreed. Those pirates[N]
have the advantage here.[AN]
We need to be careful[N]
not to be taken by surprise.[A][2X][X]





#0x915 Chapter2Opening2

[MidLeft][LoadPirate][ToggleSmile]
Hey, Boss![AN]
They're saying that some[N]
mercenary folk've showed up![AN]
And that Julio[N]
and Hesus were...[AN]

[MidRight][LoadRosh]
Killed, and they say[N]
it was these worms.[AN]
Cocky little maggots...[AN]
They think they can just[N]
prance around my island?![AN]
Do they really think so[N]
highly of themselves?[AN]
This is my turf,[N]
I know the terrain.[AN]
They won't see us coming in[N]
the fog until it's too late![AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah![A][2X][X]





#0x917 Chapter2Opening3

[MidRight][LoadRosh]
Well, that was a ruckus.[AN]
Those mercenaries'll soon be[N]
cleared out, so don't worry.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
Hmph.[N]
I don't particularly care.[AN]
What I do care about is[N]
my share of half the coin.[AN]
Give it here.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alright, ya greedy dastard.[AN]
You military folk are more villainous[N]
than me, and I'm a damned pirate.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I don't need your lip.[AN]
Just do what you're[N]
ordered to do.[AN]
...[....][AN]
Excellent.[N]
Now then...[AN]

[MidRight]
Hold on! We're not finished here.[N]
Aren't you going to help me?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Help you?[N]
...Help you?[AN]
By the gods, I am[N]
not your governor.[AN]
You made your bed,[N]
now lie in it.[AN]

[MidRight]
You kidding me?[AN]
You're the ones who[N]
ordered us to do this![AN]
Now I have to put[N]
up with it by myself?![A][2X][X]




#0x900 Chapter2Opening4

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Alright, let's move out.[AN]
For this mission, we can't[N]
see well because of the fog.[AN]
Everybody stay vigilant.[A][2X][X]




#0x916 Chapter2Opening5

[MidRight][LoadBrian]
Hm, this fog just gets[N]
worse by the minute...[AN]
Oh? Is it my turn?[AN]
Fear not, sir. My eyes[N]
are a sharp as a hawk's.[AN]
Allow me to direct[N]
you through the fog.[A][Clear][2X][X]




#0x91D Chapter2Opening6

[MidRight][LoadFerris]
Commander, I can see a[N]
ballista over there![AN]
Allow me to commandeer it.[AN]
I'm pretty well practiced[N]
on the ballista.[AN]
I can use it to attack[N]
from a long distance.[AN]
However, I'll be wide open[N]
while I'm operating it.[AN]
If possible, I'd ask you[N]
to try and protect me.[A][Clear][2X][X]





#0x923 Chapter2Ending1

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][Right][LoadBraidGirl]
Thank you for your help![N]
We... finally...[AN]

[MidLeft]
It's alright. I understand.[AN]

[Right]
It hasn't been long, but...[AN]
Even in the short time we've been[N]
here, we've suffered so much...[AN]

[FarRight][LoadLoli]
Can... can we leave?[N]
Can we go home?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Young ladies, you're free now.[AN]
You can rest assured[N]
that's the end of them.[AN]

[FarRight]
I'm so happy![AN]
Oh, um... what[N]
about Daddy?[AN]
What about everyone[N]
else in the town?[AN]

[Right]
I'm worried, too.[N]
I hope my husband is safe...[AN]
I was taken away before[N]
I could hear anything...[AN]

[MidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[AN][ToggleMouthMove]

[FarRight]
Huh?[N]
What's wrong, mister?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I don't know if I'm the right person[N]
to tell you this, but the people-[AN]

[Right]
Stop![AN]
Please, don't[N]
say anymore...[AN]
I... I had a feeling[N]
It was something like this...[AN][CloseEyes]
Sniff...[N]
Ugh...[AN]

[MidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][2X][X]





#0x925 Chapter2Ending2

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadAudrey]
Isaac, everyone who[N]
had been taken away[AN]
has been moved[N]
onto the ship,[AN]
though I'm afraid...[AN]
some of them had[N]
already... expired.[AN]
We can leave at any time.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, Audrey.[AN]
Thank you for[N]
informing me.[AN]
Let's get out of[N]
here quickly, then.[AN]

[MidRight]
...Do you remember?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'd be lying if I said I don't.[AN]

[MidRight]
Those people we've rescued[N]
can't possibly imagine[AN]
what has become of the town.[AN]
They don't have anywhere[N]
to come back to,[AN]
or anyone waiting[N]
for their return.[AN]
How are they going to react...?[AN]
The mere thought of it[N]
makes me feel ill.[AN]

[MidLeft]
We are mercenaries.[AN]
It's not our job to[N]
think about things like that.[AN]

[MidRight]
That's true...[AN]
It's not good to[N]
dwell on it...[AN]
Still, if I think[N]
about their futures...[AN]
it's unbearable...[AN]

[MidLeft]
We did as requested.[N]
We rescued them.[AN]
That alone is enough,[AN]
and we don't need to[N]
think about it any longer.[AN]

[MidRight]
You're right...[AN]
That would be[N]
for the best...[A][2X][X]

S-stop it...[AN]
What... what did we do![AN]
What are they[N]
telling you we've done?![AN]

[FarRight]
...I have nothing to say[N]
to the likes of you.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Stop!![N]
Please stop, for god's sake![AN]

Commander![AN]

[Left]
I'm almost done here.[N]
How is it going over there?[AN]

[Right]
...Why won't you call[N]
them off, commander?![AN]
This order is absurd.[AN]
Why do we have to kill[N]
everyone in this village?![AN]

[Left]
I asked how it was going.[AN]

[Right]
We're just about done...[N][....]
Hey... Commander![AN]
Are you sure you want to[N]
be a "knight" like... like this?[AN]

[Left]
...Don't talk about unimportant[N]
things during the mission.[AN]
We must execute our orders[N]
for the sake of Etruria.[AN]
Now, we don't have time to argue.[AN]

[Right]
But...[AN]

[FarRight][LoadRedSoldier]
The commander is right.[N]
We don't have any time to argue, do we?[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir! It's urgent.[AN]
There's an Etrurian platoon in the[N]
village who aren't informed of us.[AN]
What do we do? Those[N]
fools are attacking us![AN]

[Left]
...Our orders are to dispose[N]
of all the people in the village.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Are you serious?! Commander![AN]

[Left]
I'll take care of it.[N]
Lead me there.[AN]

You're the boss, right?[AN][Clear]

[MidLeft][LoadRosh]
Huh? So you're the lot[N]
runnin' around my island?[AN]
I'll make ya pay[N]
for that, lad.[AN][Clear]

[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
You have two options.[AN]
To be killed here,[AN]
or to surrender and[N]
be arrested by us.[AN][ClearText]
Choose which you like.[AN][Clear]

[MidLeft][LoadRosh]
Oi, you forgot the[N]

To kill all of[N]

#0x4A Chapter2Guide
[MidLeft][LoadWrys][MidRight][LoadKara]
Oh, dear me...[AN]
Where am I?[N]
Who am I?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hello, little Miss Kara.[AN]
I appreciate your sense of humor,[N]
but I think we both know who you are.[AN]

[MidRight]
Ehehe...[AN]

[MidLeft]
This is the Guide Corner,[N]
made to lead those astray.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, I think I get it...[AN]
So, that means I can[N]
get advice here, right?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Precisely, you're right on the mark.[N]
Now, to get to the point...[AN]
This island seems to have a dense fog.[AN]
Your vision is limited to [Red]two [Red]feet,[N]
so you shouldn't get ahead of yourself.[AN]

[MidRight]
Jeez, that short, huh...[AN]
Audrey said we should [Red]stick together.[Red][N]
I'm thinking that was good advice.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Most of the enemies here won't[N]
move until you're [Red]within their range.[Red][AN]
If you move too far ahead, you[N]
might find yourself in a tight spot.[AN]
In addition to that, some[N]
of them are fearsome dark mages.[AN]
Even Sir Isaac succumbs to[N]
their powerful dark magics.[AN]

[MidRight]
I guess he's not as resistant[N]
to magic as I am, huh.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Once you start turning the[N]
corner at the top of the map,[AN]
reinforcements will begin to[N]
appear from [Red]the central island.[Red][AN]
Be careful moving close to the beaches.[AN]

[MidRight]
There's also a ballista[N]
down near that beach...[AN]

[MidLeft]
So there is. I wouldn't recommend[N]
you fly too close, Miss Kara.[AN]
Fortunately for you, the archer[N]
inside is on orders to [Red]hold position.[Red][AN]
Was that information sufficient for you?[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh! Mr. Wrys![N]
I have a question![AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, usually on these kind of journies,[N]
you have a powerful ally with you right?[AN]
You know, a veteran knight...[N]
maybe on a horse. That kind of thing.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't you already?[AN]

[MidRight]
What do you mean?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well, Sir Issac seems to[N]
be well versed in combat.[AN]
And while he doesn't seem to gain[N]
much experience fighting weak enemies,[AN]
he still has a lot of[N]
potential to grow.[AN]

[MidRight]
When you put it that[N]
way... I guess he is.[AN]
Do you think he'd look more[N]
dashing on a majestic steed?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ahaha, I think this guide is[N]
about over. Until next time.[A][2X][X]
