#0x87F Chapter1Opening

After the group had[N]
driven away the bandits,[AN]
Isaac and the mercenaries[N]
head out to Valetta,[AN]
to rescue those who were taken away.[AN][Event]
Valetta is a port town with many fisheries[N]
and easy naval access to Etruria,[AN]
so many travel there to trade goods.[AN]
The bandits are very likely to return[N]
to their base via the Valettan port.[AN][Event]
Assuming the worst, the[N]
mercenaries walk heavily.[AN][Event]
Valletta, the biggest port town in[N]
Dia, has become a hell on earth.[AN]
The scent of death hangs in the air.[AN][Event][X]

Hey! Are you sure these are all[N]
the girls and treasures in town!?[AN]

Y...[....][N]
Yes...[....][AN]
There is nothing[N]
left in town...[....][AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmph. I expected a lot more[N]
out of a port town like this.[AN]
Boys, take another look around![N]
Kill the bastards if you have to![AN]

[MidRight]
P-please spare mercy...[....][AN]
We have to pay taxes to the lords,[N]
so this is all we have left...[....][AN]

Do I look like I care?![AN]
Shut up, and bring me[N]

Boss man! We're in trouble![AN]
I heard the guys who bumped[N]
off Julio are heading here![AN]
You didn't tell us we[N]
would be fighting anybody![AN]

[MidRight]
Hey now, you don't[N]
have to be afraid.[AN]
That idiot Julio was[N]
just taken off guard.[AN]
Those "mercenaries" can barely[N]
swing their own weapons.[AN]
Don't worry about them.[AN]
Focus on loading up the[N]
ship with goods and women.[AN]
C'mon lads, don't be[N]
afraid of those jackoffs![A][X]

Isaac...[....][N]
It's horrible...[....][AN]
Piled corpses of men,[N]
women taken away...[AN]
It's like a hell on earth.[AN]

[FarLeft]
How cruel...[AN]
There must be people in need of[N]
our aid. We have to make haste.[AN]

[FarRight][LoadKara]
Gah... it's so terrible...[....][N]
Ugh...[AN]

[Left]
Kara, I know you're not[N]
used to this kind of thing.[AN]
You don't have to strain[N]
yourself. You're still a novice.[AN]

[FarRight]
N-no.[AN]
I'll fight too.[N]
I can't allow this![AN]

[Clear][LoadOlson]
Commander, give[N]
us your orders.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadKara]

[Left]
Let's calm down.[AN]
We have to gather more[N]
information first.[AN]
Kara, can I ask[N]
you to scout?[AN]

[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Y-yes.[N]
I'll go.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][FarLeft][Clear]

It's not safe for you.[AN]

[MidRight]
...[....][N]
Thank you...[A][Clear][X]





#0x8EC Chapter1OpeningPart7

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadKara]
Commander! It's urgent![AN]
Those pirates are holding the village[N]
girls under the deck of their boat.[AN]
I wanted to get a closer look but...[....][AN]
There was a wyvern and a ballista[N]
preventing me from getting in closer...[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's good enough.[N]
Nice work, Kara.[AN]
Strange, though.[AN]
Where did these bastards[N]
get hold of a wyvern...?[AN]

[MidRight]
[CloseEyes]Hm, I'm not sure...[....][OpenEyes][N]
But, I know I saw them![AN]

[MidLeft]
At any rate, if that's true,[N]
we don't have very much time.[AN]
We'll have to seize the boat[N]
now, before it goes out to sea.[A][X]

#0x8F1 Chapter1FerrisBrianSpawns

[MidRight][LoadBrian][MidLeft][LoadFerris]
Huff...[....]huff...[....][N]
Did we make it...?[AN]

[MidRight]
That wasn't too bright.[AN]
As a gentleman, you shouldn't[N]
display such arrogant tardiness.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Brian, aren't you tired with that physique?[N]
Actually, how are you faster than me?![AN]

[MidRight]
Heh heh, my friend, I know how[N]
to work with my lovely shape.[AN]
That aside...[....][N]
This is a horrible sight, no?[AN]

[MidLeft]
We must be too late...[....][N]
Gods, damn it all![AN]

[MidRight]
No no, it's too[N]
early to give up.[AN]
Also, it seems somebody[N]
was here before us.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You mean the commander and[N]
the others are in this town?[AN]

[MidRight]
That seems to be the case.[N]
We should join them.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, let's hurry![A][X]

#0x901 Chapter1House

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadBlondeHairMan]
I was allowed to live...[AN]
Just because I'm the[N]
mayor of this town.[AN]
I could only look on[AN]
while the people were[N]
taken away, or killed.[AN]
I'm sorry...[AN]
I'm so sorry.[A][X]





#0x8F7 Chapter1EndEvent

[Right][LoadHesus][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Come on, tell us where[N]
your damned base is.[AN]
Where have you taken the people[N]
of this town and the village?[AN]

[Right]
Y-you...[AN]
Don't think I'll let[N]
you get away with this...[AN]
Y-you shall pay...[AN]

[MidLeft]
I see. So that's your answer.[N]
You've got a lot of nerve.[AN]
If that's the case, then...[AN]

[Right][MoveMidRight]
Wait, wait![AN]
I'll talk! I'll tell ya,[N]
so please forgive me![AN]
To the northwest... from this port,[N]
there is an isolated island...[AN]
I have a map on this ship...[AN]

[MidLeft]
A map? I saw no[N]
such thing on board.[AN]
Where the hell is it?[AN]

[MidRight]
The m-map is...[N]
It's right here...[AN]
Here, p-please...[AN]
You'll... you'll[N]
spare me, right?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Spare you?[AN]
You sound exactly like[N]
all the people you killed.[AN]
And I'll make sure[N]
you meet the same fate.[AN]

[MidRight]
S-stop![A][X]





#0x8F8 Chapter1EndEvent2

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadAudrey]
Seems the pirates[N]
have been broken up.[AN]

[MidLeft]
It seems that the women were[N]
taken away to this island.[AN]
We couldn't save the people in town...[AN]
The least we can do is rescue[N]
those who were kidnapped.[AN]
That is... our duty.[AN]

[MidRight]
I feel the same way, Isaac.[AN]
Let's kill those pirates,[N]
rescue those people and come home.[AN]
That would avenge those[N]
who have been killed.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah...[N]
I hope so.[A][X]





#0x48 Chapter1Guide
[MidLeft][LoadHesus]
Tsk, what a cheap-ass town.[AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
Huh?[AN]
Who the hell's there?[AN]

[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Looks like I've found where[N]
you were hiding. This ends here.[AN]

[MidLeft]
W-wait![AN]
This is the guide...[N]
At least play fair...[AN]

[MidRight]
...Alright, alright. So,[N]
what do you have to tell me?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Bahaha! Okay, pay attention now.[AN]
This is going to be a rough time,[N]
since, after all, you're up against ME.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, yeah. Pushover.[AN]
Anyways, will those pirates[N]
be attacking the houses?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Huh? Why would we do that?[N]
We already looted the bastards.[AN]
Gahaha![AN]

[MidRight]
I see.[AN]

[MidLeft]
What you do want to look out for,[N]
though, are the [Red]cracked walls [Red]up top.[AN]
One is just for passage, but the[N]
other may contain [Red]something valuable.[Red][AN]
Once you enter the passge, the[N]
wyvern will begin to attack you.[AN]

[MidRight]
The wyvern rider, huh...[AN]
What a pain. Maybe I should[N]
use [Red]the ballista [Red]to attack it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Once you get close to me, we'll[N]
send in some [Red]more reinforcements.[Red][AN]
Good luck with just standing and[N]
waiting in the ballista's range.[AN]
And I don't intend on sitting around.[N]
[Red]Enter my range[Red] and see what happens.[AN]

[MidRight]
I think I've got the gist of it.[N]
See you on the battlefield, worm.[AN]
[ClearFace]

[MidLeft]
Jeez, that man is fearsome...[A][X]
