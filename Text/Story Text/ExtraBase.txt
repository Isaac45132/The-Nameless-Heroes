Are you ready?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, of course![N]
I'll give it my all![AN]
I may not look like much, but[N]
I take pride in my swordsmanship![AN]

[MidLeft]
Great, then, let's see[N]
how you fare against me.[AN]
Let's try not to hurt each[N]
other too badly though.[AN]

[MidRight]
Thanks for your concern.[N]
Okay, then let's do this![A][2X][X]





#0x8EF ExtraBaseEnding
[MidRight][LoadLizzy][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Had enough?[AN]

[MidRight]
Don't...[AN][MoveMidRight]
underestimate me![AN][MoveMidRight][ClearSpeech]

[MidLeft][MoveRight]
...In that case.[AN][Event]

[MidRight]
...![AN]

[Right]
This fight[N]
is over.[AN][Event]
[Right][Clear][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]

[MidRight]
I... lost...[.....][AN]
I hate to admit it, but[N]
you really are far stronger.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You did well, Miss Lizzy.[N]
If I had to pick something,[AN]
I'd say you don't have[N]
enough battlefield experience.[AN]
Sparring and daily drills[N]
are important too, but...[AN]
In the end, what's really[N]
important is actual battle.[AN]
If you don't fight real battles,[AN]
you just won't be able to[N]
see what's truly important.[AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[MidLeft]
The more you fight for real,[N]
the stronger you'll become.[AN]

[MidRight]
Y-you think so?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes, in fact,[N]
I guarantee it.[AN]

[MidRight]
Thank you so much![AN]
Speaking of, what are[N]
your group's plans now?[AN]

[MidLeft]
After we've seen you[N]
guys off to the island,[AN]
we'll rest and then head[N]
back to the mainland.[AN]

[MidRight]
I see... that's too bad.[AN]
I guess that means we'll[N]
be saying goodbye soon.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, I guess so.[AN]
Until then, we can help[N]
you with your training.[AN]
If you don't mind.[AN]

[MidRight]
No, of course I don't mind![N]
Please do teach me all you can.[AN]

[MidLeft]
It would be my[N]
pleasure, Lizzy.[A][2X][X]




#0x5D ExtraBaseGuide
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadLizzy]
Alright, Sir Isaac...[N]
I'm not gonna lose![AN]
Here I come! Haah![AN]
[ClearSpeech][MoveLeft]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Hold a moment.[AN]

[Left]
H-Huh? Is there[N]
something wrong?[AN]
[Clear][MidRight][LoadLizzy]

[MidLeft]
Did you bother to[N]
check my abilities?[AN]
If you can't do that,[AN]
it'll be tough for[N]
you to win battles.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, you're right![N]
Let me look, then...[AN]
Hm... you have a shield...[N]
Wait, we're on a timer too?[AN]
Aren't you going to at least[N]
give me a chance, Sir Isaac?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Let's not suggest I'm[N]
fixing the match, here.[AN]
I'm actually doing my[N]
best to hold back on you.[AN]
If you can impress me,[AN]
I'll award you with[N]
this [Red]Seraph Robe.[Red][AN]
I'll [Red]only attack you,[Red][AN]
so feel free to [Red]hide[N]
behind your allies.[Red][AN]
If you change your[N]
mind about fighting me,[AN]
you can just stand away[N]
from me and run the timer.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hiding behind my allies[N]
doesn't feel very knightly...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Once you're in my range,[N]
it's difficult to escape,[AN]
since I can outpace you.[AN]
You should take advantage[N]
of the resources you have.[AN]

[MidRight]
It's still not how[N]
a knight should act...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well, in this case,[AN]
I obviously [Red]won't[N]
kill you if you lose,[Red][AN]
so how you fight here[N]
is really up to you.[AN]

[MidRight]
H-huh. Should I be[N]
happy about that...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Your best bet to defeat[N]
me is a magic sword.[AN]
A [Red]Light Brand [Red]does[N]
nicely, if you have one.[AN]

[MidRight]
I think I might...[AN]
Anyways, I think I have[N]
everything figured out now.[AN]
Let's resume our match![N]
Hyaaaah![AN][ClearSpeech][MoveLeft]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
J-just hold on[N]
another moment...[AN]

[Left]
What is it[N]
this time?[AN]
[Clear][MidRight][LoadLizzy]

[MidLeft]
This is still the Guide Corner.[N]
We need to get back to the arena.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, you're right![A][2X][X]

I won't lose![N]
Let's do this![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Strike when you're ready.[N]
Show me what you're made of.[A][2X][X]

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
How's this?[AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight][LoadLizzy]
Argh...! You're[N]
way too strong...[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Oh, so you're[N]
still standing?[AN]
Heh. I'm impressed.[AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight][LoadLizzy]
D-don't underestimate me![N]
I'm a knight, after all![AN]
T-this is nothing![A][2X][X]




#0x90E ExtraBaseIsaacDefeat

[TMM]...![TMM][AN]
Very well done.[N]
...However![A][2X][X]
