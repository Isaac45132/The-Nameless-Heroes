#0x87B PrologueOpening

To the west of Elibe, there are islands.[A][Event][N]
On the northeast is Dia.[A][Event][N]
Down to the south is Caldonia.[AN]
And between the two islands is Fibernia.[A][Event][N]
Together, these three islands are[N]
called The Western Isles.[AN]
Each island has rich mines,[N]
which are being developed actively.[AN]
The largest of the mines is Eburacum,[N]
on the northern end of Fibernia.[AN]
The Western Isles are a[N]
protectorate of Etruria.[AN]
Nobles of some areas of the three islands,[N]
as lords, govern their own territories.[AN]
In Jutes, an area among said territories,[N]
Etrurians established their administration[AN]
headquarters, and all issues on the islands[N]
are decided after Jutes has approved.[AN]
From Jutes, messengers are sent[N]
to the lords of the islands.[AN]
"Gather men from all over the islands,[N]
and mobilize them to Eburacum."[AN]
Under this message, the lords, in a hurry,[N]
gather men from all over the islands.[AN]
The enforcement is so suppressive that[N]
some of the citizens formed a "Resistance"[AN]
and for a while they have fought against[N]
the pirates, who aim at the wealth on the[AN]
islands and the Etrurian Lords. At these[N]
islands, in such a threatening atmosphere,[AN]
arrives a group of mercenaries.[A][Event][N]
The name of their commander is Isaac.[AN]
The members of this group were originally[AN]
knights of Etruria, but an affair forced[N]
them to leave the country.[AN]
After they disappeared, they formed a group[N]
of mercenaries to make their livelihoods.[AN]
To earn their keep, they wandered[N]
about Elibe as mercenaries,[AN]
and eventually arrived at[N]
Dia of The Western Isles.[AN]
This story begins a half year later...[AN]
Isaac and the mercenaries are working[N]
as hired guards of a village.[AN]
Starting now, they are involved[N]
in a battle in The Western Isles[AN]
which was lost through history.[AN][2X][X]





#0x8C3 PrologueMemory1

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadSoldier]
Commander![AN]
Is it really OK?[AN]
Commander! Please answer my question![AN]
Is that village really...[AN]
the village of thieves said[N]
to be pillaging the area?![AN]

[MidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]

[MidLeft]
Commander![AN]
We haven't found any evidence,[N]
not even a trace, of their robberies![AN]
Soldiers happened to be stationed there,[N]
and they were only the lord's soldiers![AN]
And aside from them, they[N]
were just civilians...[AN]
Without any experience on the[N]
battlefield, they were just...[AN]
And we're just killing them![AN]

[MidRight]
That is the order we received.[AN]
They are enemies of the country,[N]
and they are pillaging the area.[AN]
We are not killing[N]
any unrelated civilians.[AN]
We are just fulfilling our[N]
duties as "knights".[AN]
Be careful of your words.[AN]
We mustn't let other countries know that[N]
this is the work of Etruria, at all costs.[AN]
We were directly ordered by[N]
Etrurian nobles themselves.[AN]
There's no reason for[N]
doubting our orders.[AN]

[MidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]

[MidRight]
Anything more to say?[AN]

[MidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove].....[ToggleMouthMove][AN]

[MidRight]
Then we go on with our mission.[AN]
Now, we must set each house on fire[N]
and leave this village.[AN]
After that, our mission is complete.[A][2X][X]





#0x8CD PrologueStartEvent1

[FarLeft][LoadIsaac][CloseEyes][MidRight][LoadKara]
Hey! Commander![AN]
Commander! Heyyy![AN]
Can you hear me!?[N]
Hell-ooo![AN]

[FarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]
...[AN]
.....[AN]
..........[OpenEyes]![AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Oh, sorry.[N]
Did you want to talk about something?[AN]

[MidRight]
Jeez![AN]
You qualifying me as a[N]
full-fledged pegasus knight,[AN]
that's what I want to talk about![AN]
You've seen, haven't you?[AN]
How I've been doing so[N]
well in battle recently?![AN]

[FarLeft]
I admit you're working hard,[N]
but I can't qualify a novice like you.[AN]

[MidRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
What?! Why not?![AN]
You've often complimented my skills[N]
recently, haven't you, commander?[AN]

[FarLeft]
I only compliment you so you can do better.[N]
But you'd do well not to get carried away.[AN]

[MidRight]
Tsk...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Audrey, say something to her.[AN]

[Left][LoadAudrey]
Kara, Isaac could qualify you[N]
as a full-fledged pegasus knight,[AN]
right here and now. Why do you[N]
think he doesn't do that?[AN]

[MidRight]
Because he doesn't[N]
want to let me go?[AN]

[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadOlson]
She's an idiot,[N]
as always...[AN]

[MidRight]
Jeez! You're so mean![AN]

[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadEdmund]
Now now, everyone.[N]
Don't tease her.[AN]
We all know Kara has[N]
been working hard.[AN]

[MidRight]
Aw, sir Ed...[AN]

[Left]
Ed, don't spoil her now.[AN]
On the battlefield, one aims[N]
at the easiest target.[AN]
Kara, if we let you back[N]
while you're still a novice,[AN]
you'll end up being[N]
killed before long.[AN]
Isaac can't help being[N]
anxious about you.[AN]
So that you aren't killed[N]
after you return to Ilia,[AN]
he wants you to leave when[N]
you are experienced enough.[AN]
Do you understand, Kara?[AN]

[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadIsaac]
Audrey, don't say such[N]
unnecessary things.[AN]

[Left][ClearFace][LoadMorris]
Sir commander is so thoughtful.[AN]
Kara, you are quite blessed.[AN]
When I was a new recruit, it was[ToggleMouthMove]...[N]
...?[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Hmm... It seems rather noisy[N]
outside, doesn't it?[AN]

[MidRight]
Ah! I wonder if it's an[N]
entertainer or something.[AN]
I like entertainers![N]
Hey, can I go and see?[AN]

[Left]
Wait, Kara.[AN]
Just listen to us before going.[AN]

[MidRight][CloseEyes]
Um, umm...[AN]
But you talk so long...[AN]

[FarLeft]
...That's strange.[AN]
I never heard of any[N]
events being planned.[A][2X][X]






#0x8C9 PrologueStartEvent2

[MidLeft][LoadBrownHairMan]
Oh, no...!![AN]
It's bandits![N]
Bandits are attacking us![AN]
And judging from the direction[N]
they're coming from,[AN]
I'd say they already ransacked[N]
the neighbouring village...[A][2X][X]




#0x8CA PrologueStartEvent3

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Bandits...[....][AN]
Alright, we have a job to do.[N]
Let's move![A][2X][X]




#0x8CB PrologueStartEvent4
[Right][LoadKara][FarRight][LoadOlson][FarLeft][LoadIsaac]
The enemies are coming[N]
faster than I thought.[AN]
Seems they snuck up[N]
on us from behind.[AN]
Audrey and I will take[N]
on the front line.[AN]
Olson, Morris, you[N]
support us from the back.[AN]
Kara, you focus on scouting.[AN]
Get the enemies' information[N]
to us quickly.[AN]
And be careful not to[N]
rush too far ahead.[AN]

[Right]
Jeez! No need to boss[N]
me around y'know![AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadMorris]

[FarLeft]
Morris, have you figured out[N]
how to use those staves yet?[AN]

[Right]
Yes, sir. Leave it to me.[AN]
I finally got the[N]
knack for it recently.[AN]
If someone gets hurt,[N]
just give me a shout.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Olson, is your[N]
tome still usable?[AN]

[FarRight]
I bought a new one[N]
a little while ago.[AN]
I'm good to go.[AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadAudrey]

[FarRight]
Isaac, my axes seem[N]
to still be alright.[AN]

[Right][Clear][LoadEdmund]
Don't worry, family.[N]
I'll protect you all.[AN]

[FarLeft]
No problems, then? Alright.[AN]
Listen up. Right now,[N]
we're low on supplies.[AN]
But by capturing enemies,[N]
we can supply ourselves.[AN]
Try to find and[N]
capture weakened ones,[AN]
and take their weapons.[AN]
Now, we rout those[N]
bandit scum. Let's go![A][2X][X]





#0x8D4 PrologueTurn1Enemy

[MidRight][LoadJulio]
Damn, they hired mercenaries...[....][AN]
But how long can they hold out[N]
with so few fighters?[AN]
Boys! Do 'em in![A][2X][X]





#0x8E2 PrologueTurn2WolfSpawn

[MidRight][LoadWolf]
Well, well...[....][AN]
It seems they went and started[N]
something while I was gone.[AN]
Guess I should go help[N]
out the boss-man.[AN]
Nobody can stand up to the Wolf![A][2X][X]





#0xD11 PrologueTalkIsaacWolf

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadWolf]
Yo! Old man![N]
Ya makin' a ruckus, huh?[AN]

[MidRight]
Welcome back, Wolf.[N]
Good timing.[AN]
We could use the help[N]
against these bandits.[AN]
Take to the[N]
front with me.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Gotcha, gotcha.[N]
At yer command, boss![A][2X][X]





#0x8D6 PrologueVSJulio

[MidLeft][LoadJulio]
I'll start by killing you![A][2X][X]





#0x8DD PrologueIsaacVSJulio

[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
You've been razing this[N]
village for your own gain...[AN]
I'll make you pay for that.[AN]

[Clear][MidLeft][LoadJulio]
Curses![AN]
Who the hell[N]
are you people!?[AN]
My men were[N]
no damned match![A][2X][X]





#0x8D7 PrologueJulioDeath

[MidLeft][LoadJulio]
Wh-what the hell...?[A][2X][X]






#0x8D8 PrologueChapterEnd

[Left][LoadAudrey][FarLeft][LoadIsaac]
The fight seems to have[N]
finally settled down.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadMoneyMan]
Sir Isaac! We have a problem![AN]

[FarLeft]
Mayor, we've cleared[N]
most of the bandits.[AN]
What's the problem now?[AN]

[MidRight]
All of the young girls[N]
in the village were taken away![AN]

[FarLeft]
...So it was just[N]
a distraction, huh?[AN]

[Left]
The neighboring town to[N]
here has the only port[AN]
with the capacity for[N]
a moderately-sized boat.[AN]
Those brigands should be[N]
planning to go out to sea[AN]
and take the girls[N]
to their hideout.[AN]

[MidRight]
Sir Isaac, please...[....][N]
for god's sake,[AN]
help our girls...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Of course, Mayor.[N]
We'll head out right away.[AN]

[MidRight][Clear][Left][Clear][MidRight][LoadAudrey]

[FarLeft]
Audrey, we're going to[N]
the neighboring town soon.[AN]
Get everything prepared.[AN]

[MidRight]
Sure thing.[AN]
These bandits are acting[N]
so bold as of late.[AN]
This can't be a good sign...[....][AN]

[FarLeft]
There's no point[N]
lulling on about it.[AN]
We're leaving as[N]
soon as we're ready.[A][2X][X]





#0x92C PrologueVillage1

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadBlondeHairMan]
Since the new lords came from[N]
Etruria, things haven't gone well.[AN]
They must be up to something[N]
behind closed doors...[....][AN]
Here, I'll give this to you.[N]
Wipe out those bandits, please![A][2X][X]





#0x909 PrologueVillage2

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadBrownHairMan]
Some village girls have[N]
already been carried off...[AN]
And the neighboring village is...[AN]
What the hell is going on...?![AN]
Please... Take this![N]
Do anything to drive them away![A][2X][X]





#0x93E PrologueVillage3

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadBraidGirl]
Your female companion[N]
left this here.[AN]
There you go.[AN]
You're the only ones[N]
able to protect us.[AN]
Please, I beg you...[N]
save our village...[A][2X][X]





#0x90F PrologueVillage4

[MidRight][LoadCurrent]
...Is nobody home?[A][2X][X]









#0x8D3 PrologueRangeEvent

[MidRight][LoadJulio]
Hey, buddies![N]
Get out here![A][2X][X]





#0x49 PrologueGuide

[MidLeft][LoadWrys][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
[ToggleMouthMove]...?[.....][AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Where... am I?[AN]
Last I remember, I was thinking about[N]
protecting the village from bandits...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Welcome, sir Isaac.[AN]
And "thinking" is not an option![N]
You must stop the bandits![AN]

[MidRight]
A joke's a joke, old man.[N]
And who are you, exactly?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Just call me...[....][N]
"The Grand Mysterious Tactician Priest."[AN]

[MidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
You are really confident[N]
about yourself, huh.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Now, now. They don't call me[N]
that for nothing, you know.[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm not going to comment about your name.[N]
Anyways, where in the hell is this?[AN]

[MidLeft]
This is the Guide Corner.[N]
I will help you along your way here.[AN]

[MidRight]
Guide Corner...?[AN]
That means you'll give me[N]
intel here, right?[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's correct.[AN]
Let me explain some useful[N]
combat information.[AN]
We'll begin with [Red]Leadership[Red].[AN]
For each Leadership Star[N]
within your allied forces,[AN]
all of your allies will gain[N]
[Red]3% accuracy and avoidance[Red].[AN]
For the enemy, it is [Red]5% [Red]for each.[AN]
It will affect a lot on the battlefield,[N]
so make sure to pay attention.[AN]
Secondly, there's [Red]Capture[Red].[AN]
This command will appear when [Red]your[N]
constitution is higher [Red]than the enemy's.[AN]
If you can defeat the enemy,[N]
you will capture them.[AN]
By doing this you can [Red]take[N]
their items and weapons[Red].[AN]
Also, when you release the[N]
enemy, you will gain [Red]10 EXP[Red].[AN]
But, when trying to capture, [Red]your[N]
skill and speed will be halved[Red].[AN]

[MidRight]
That sounds like an[N]
important tactic.[AN]
I'll have to keep my eyes open for[N]
opportunites to make use of it.[AN][2X][X]

#0x8 PrologueGuide2

[MidLeft]
There are some other important things[N]
to go over, but I'll cover those later.[AN]
If you get stuck, consider [Red]reading[N]
the included text[Red].[AN]

[MidRight]
That's all well and nice, but how about[N]
some advice for the current situation?[AN]

[MidLeft]
For these goons?[AN]
Most of them are just waiting for[N]
you to get close so they can jump you.[AN]
May be good to practice capturing.[AN]
Actually, I think there are some bandits[N]
[Red]hiding in a house down below [Red]for you to[AN]
get to [Red]the lower half [Red]of the village.[AN]
Seems like they're ready to signal their[N]
friends to start attacking as well,[AN]
so be careful when you start to[N]
get to the south side.[AN]
Also, keep your eyes open[N]
for [Red]hidden treasures[Red].[AN]
You'll find them all over the[N]
place throughout your journey.[AN]
In fact, I think I saw[N]
something on [Red]that ship[Red]...[AN]

[MidRight]
Hidden Treasure, huh?[AN]
That sounds important.[N]
Am I going to need it?[AN]

[MidLeft]
No worries about that.[AN]
It's helpful to have,[N]
but [Red]not necessary[Red].[AN]

[MidRight]
I see. Thank you.[AN]
I'll be counting on you[N]
next time, then.[AN][2X][X]





#0x5E9 PrologueTimestamp
Present[2X][X]





#0xF0F PrologueShout
Oh, no...[N]
This is serious![A][2X][X]




#0xFC1 PrologueHermesTurn1
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadHermes]
Hey there, commander![N]
Did I make it in time?[AN]
It's not easy to get going[N]
on such a short notice![AN]

[MidLeft]
I was wondering where[N]
you went off to, Hermes.[AN]
Is everything ready?[AN]

[MidRight]
You bet! I'm all ready to[N]
serve your item storage needs.[AN]
If you need help managing your[N]
inventory, give me a call.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't let me[N]
down, Hermes.[A][2X][X]
