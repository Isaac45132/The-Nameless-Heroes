[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadChloe]
Commander, sorry I'm late.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Chloe, welcome back.[N]
Don't worry about it.[AN]
I'm just glad you're back safe.[AN]
What about Titor, Sofia,[N]
Berkus and Johnny?[AN]
Not that I expect[N]
them to be in danger...[AN]

[MidRight]
They were given another mission...[N]
I came back alone, to deliver a message.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Alright. If that's the case,[AN]
then I guess you already[N]
completed your last mission.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hmph. Yeah.[N]
No problems there, but...[AN]
This town looks like[N]
it's in quite a mess...[AN]

[MidLeft]
...This whole area was[N]
assaulted by those pirates.[AN]
They even attacked the[N]
village our base is in.[AN]

[MidRight]
They went that far...[N]
So, what are we going to do now?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right now we're looking for[N]
someone to give us passage.[AN]
As soon as we find one, we'll[N]
attack the pirate's hideout.[AN]

[MidRight]
All right, I suppose I'll join you.[N]
It's always good to have more allies.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Are you sure?[N]
You've just returned.[AN]

[MidRight]
No need to worry about me.[N]
I've got it under control.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thank you then, Chloe.[N]
Lend us your blade.[A][2X][X]





#0x938 Chapter1BaseTalkIsaacAudrey

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadAudrey]
Isaac, we've arranged a boat.[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, that's good.[N]
Sooner than I'd expected.[AN]
Although the pirates'[N]
boat was available...[AN]
There was nobody who[N]
knew how to drive it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Most of the town's men were killed[N]
or evacuated, so no sailors were left.[AN]
We arranged with people on a merchant[N]
ship which happened to stop at the port.[AN]

[MidRight]
I see. Guess we[N]
got lucky.[AN]
Have you told them[N]
where we're going?[AN]
Nobody would want to get[N]
involved with these pirates.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't worry, Isaac. I've already told them.[AN]
They said they'll take us there,[N]
even knowing it's the pirates' base.[AN]
They loved to come here to trade...[AN]
They don't need money from us.[N]
They say they want to support us.[AN]

[MidRight]
It's nice to hear that.[N]
Well, now that we've arranged a boat,[AN]
we've got nothing left but to our job.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right. Those pirates made fools of us.[N]
We must make them pay dearly for that![AN][Clear]

[MidRight]
I don't mind the enthusiasm, but...[N]
try to keep your cool, Audrey.[A][2X][X]





#0xA9D Chapter1BaseTalkWolfPhelix

[MidLeft][LoadWolf][MidRight][LoadPhelix]
Hey! Wolf![AN]
Guess we're both[N]
still OK, huh?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Moron...[AN]
Who d'ya think I am, eh?![AN]
I can tell ya I'm not a man[N]
to get bested by some sea-dogs.[AN]

[MidRight]
I know that![AN]
Anyways, if you need something,[N]
just give me a shout, alright?[AN]
Later![AN][Clear]

[MidLeft]
That bonehead seems to be running[N]
around checking up on everyone.[AN]
I remember when I had[N]
energy like that... heh.[A][2X][X]





#0x903 Chapter1BaseTalkIsaacBrian

[MidLeft][LoadBrian][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Brian, have you seen Hermes?[AN]
I wanted to check up[N]
on our supplies, but...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, Hermes?[AN]
Now that you mention it,[N]
I think I saw him over the counter.[AN]
He should come if you call him from[N]
over the counter, I would think.[AN]

[MidRight]
I see, thanks.[N]
I'll try that, then.[AN]

[MidLeft]
By the by, he seemed to be [N]
clenching onto something,[AN]
muttering "Looks like I can[N]
make some good money".[AN]
Anyways, until next time.[AN][Clear]

[MidRight]
What is he up to now...?[AN]
I guess I'll have to[N]
find out for myself.[AN]
He should just be[N]
over the counter.[A][2X][X]



#0x995 Chapter1BaseTalkKaraFerris

[MidLeft][LoadFerris][MidRight][LoadKara]
Ah, hey Ferris![AN]
Welcome back from[N]
your mission![AN]

[MidLeft]
Ahaha, thanks, Kara.[AN]

[MidRight]
I was worried you wouldn't make it in[N]
time, since you had left the village.[AN]

[MidLeft]
On our way back to the village, we[N]
heard the town was being attacked.[AN]
We headed here, thinking that we[N]
could help save the town...[AN]
But I was surprised that all[N]
of you guys were already there.[AN]
And that the village...[N]
Well, about what happened...[....][AN]

[MidRight]
Right.[AN]
Pirates suddenly attacked. They[N]
captured the town's women.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I see. So that's what happened.[AN]
If that's the case, we'll just[N]
have to work hard to save them.[AN]

[MidRight]
That's true, but...[AN]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[....][AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Can I talk to you[N]
for a moment, Ferris?[AN]

[MidLeft]
What's the matter, Kara?[AN]

[MidRight]
It's been a full year since[N]
I joined these mercenaries...[AN]
And that whole time, we haven't[N]
fought anybody but bandits,[AN]
and we're always just[N]
protecting viallges.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's true...[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm really happy to be in this group,[N]
even if it's just for my training.[AN]
But...[AN]
I'm worried that we're only doing[N]
such simple work because of me.[AN]
I don't want to hold everyone back.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That has nothing to[N]
do with you, Kara.[AN]
Isaac just wants to have[N]
a stable base somewhere,[AN]
and take his time with work.[AN]
Besides, the rest of us[N]
are all okay with it too.[AN]

[MidRight]
If you say so, Ferris, then...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Huh, really? I'm surprised[N]
you'd take my word like that.[AN]
It's kind of... unexpected.[AN]

[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
H-hey! Jeez![AN]
Don't make a big[N]
deal out of this![AN]

[MidLeft]
Alright, alright...[A][2X][X]





#0xAC8 Chapter1BaseTalkEdmundOlson

[MidLeft][LoadOlson][MidRight][LoadEdmund]
Hey, Olson?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, Ed.[N]
You look rather cheerful.[AN]

[MidRight][ToggleSmile]
For good reason! Ta-dah![AN]
Would you like to take a[N]
break and eat these with me?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hm? Baked goods? They[N]
look pretty expensive.[AN]
You bought them[N]
for yourself, right?[AN]
I wouldn't want to[N]
take any from you.[AN]

[MidRight]
Now now, brother.[AN]
These kinds of things are best[N]
eaten with people you care about![AN]
Please, help yourself![AN]


[MidLeft]
If you insist... maybe[N]
one or two couldn't hurt.[AN]
Heh, well, let's see here...[A][2X][X]





#0xB73 Chapter1BaseTalkMorrisHestia

[MidLeft][LoadHestia][ToggleSmile][Beat][AN][ToggleSmile]
[MidRight][LoadMorris]
You seem to be in an awfully[N]
good mood there, Hestia.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Quite so. It's just...[AN]
so satisfying to[N]
have burned so much.[AN]
Ahh... I feel splendid.[AN]

[MidRight]
Those were people, you know.[N]
Don't you feel... anything?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmm... nope.[AN]
They are bandits, you know.[N]
They were destined to die.[AN]
[ToggleSmile]
So I can enjoy roasting them![N]
No hesitation! Full force![AN][ToggleSmile]

[MidRight][CloseEyes]
Oh, for the[N]
love of...[A][2X][X]







#0xA59 Chapter1BaseTalkIsaacHermes

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadHermes]
Ah, welcome, sir...[....][AN]
Oh! Well if it isn't[N]
you, commander![AN]
How did you notice[N]
I was doing business here?[AN]
Did someone tell you?[AN]
Or was it our[N]
good Lady Luck?[AN]

[MidRight]
This some kinda stall?[AN]
I just happened to run into it...[AN]
See, someone was worried about a[N]
pickpocket, so I've been looking around.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, well...[AN]
They're not[N]
exactly wrong...[AN]

[MidRight]
I don't care if you do business here.[N]
Just... stay out of trouble, alright?[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
W-wait! Wait! Commander![AN]

[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
What?[AN]

[MidLeft]
You're already here, right?[N]
Why not buy something?[AN]

[MidRight]
I guess I could, if you[N]
have anything useful.[AN]
What exactly are[N]
you dealing here?[AN]

[MidLeft]
This stall sells rare items.[N]
You won't find them anywhere else![AN]
Today I'm selling something[N]
really valuable, only 600 gold![AN]

[MidRight]
600 gold...?[N]
That's not exactly expensive...[AN]

[MidLeft]
So, what do you think?[A][2X][X]





#0xA5A Chapter1BaseRefusal

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadHermes]
You won't?[AN]
Can you not[N]
afford it?[AN][2X][X]





#0xA5B Chapter1BaseNoFunds

[MidRight]
I'm afraid I[N]
can't afford it...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh dear, is that so?[N]
I guess you're having trouble...[AN]
But, don't worry about it.[AN]
If you can find the gold,[N]
come talk to me again![A][2X][X]





#0xA5C Chapter1BaseSelection

[MidRight]
What should I say?[N][Yes][2X][X]





#0xA5D Chapter1BasePaying

[MidRight]
All right, I'll[N]
pay. There you are.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Wonderful, thank you![AN]
There you are.[AN]
If you come by next time,[N]
I'll have something else for you.[AN]
I look forward to seeing you again![AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, are you staying here?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yup. I'm not going anywhere.[AN]
Feel free to drop by again.[N]
Until next time, commander![AN][Clear]

[MidRight]
Hm...[N]
This doesn't seem half bad.[A][2X][X]



#0xA5E Chapter1BaseRefusal2

[MidRight]
I'm sorry to say...[N]
I'm not buying it this time.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, dear...[N]
I'm sorry to hear that.[AN]
If you change your mind,[N]
please come see me again![A][2X][X]





#0xD3E Chapter1BaseVillageEvent

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadGeronimo]
I'm Geronimo, the recorder.[AN]
I'm in charge of recording[N]
everyone's Ranking.[AN]
Please, take a look.[A][2X][X]





#0xD36 Chapter1BaseVillageEvent2

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft]
This is the dojo.[AN]
You can train here[N]
up to three times.[AN]
Are you ready? Here we go![A][2X][X]





#0x55C Chapter1BaseVillageEvent3

[MidLeft][LoadWrys]
Ho-ho.[AN]
How nice of you to come here.[AN]
This is the "Support[N]
Consultation Office".[AN]
If you donate 500 gold,[N]
I can erase your supports.[A][ClearText]
Shall I?[N][No][2X][X]





#0x55D Chapter1BaseVillageEvent3Part2

[MidLeft][LoadWrys]
I sincerely appreciate your donation.[N]
Now, the past has been undone.[AN]
Do not fret, my child. The[N]
path to new bonds is now opened.[AN]
Ho-ho.[A][2X][X]





#0x95B Chapter1BaseVillageEvent3Part3

[MidLeft][LoadWrys]
Dear me...![AN]
It seems that you[N]
don't have enough gold.[AN]
When you have the 500 gold,[N]
come talk to me again.[A][2X][X]




#0x979 Chapter1BaseVillageEvent3Part4

[MidLeft][LoadWrys]
This is the "Support[N]
Consultation Office"...[AN]
but you seem to like[N]
being by yourself.[AN]
However, by having[N]
relationships with people,[AN]
you can gain various[N]
things, in my opinion.[AN]
If you build a[N]
relationship with someone,[AN]
and overcome[N]
hardships with them...[AN]
Then, you are welcome[N]
to come and see me.[AN]
I'm certain that I'll[N]
be of service to you.[A][2X][X]
