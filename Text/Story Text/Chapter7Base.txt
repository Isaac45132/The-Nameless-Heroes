#0x93A Chapter7BaseIsaacJesterTalk

[MidLeft][LoadJester][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Ah, you're Jester, right?[AN]
We may only be working[N]
together for a short time,[AN]
but I'll be counting on you.[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
Y-yes sir![AN]
You gave me some helpful[N]
advice back there, so...[AN]
Allow me to say thanks![AN]

[MidRight]
No need for that. And besides,[AN]
everyone get nervous in battle,[N]
especially when they're new.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hmm, well...[AN]
Mr. Isaac, do you ever get[N]
scared out on the battlefield?[AN]

[MidRight]
Of course I do, sometimes.[AN]
Staring death in the face...[N]
It would frighten anyone.[AN]
In any case, concentrate on[N]
moving at our pace instead.[AN]
You'll do no good running[N]
headfirst into a stray lance.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'll try to keep[N]
that in mind.[AN]

[MidRight]
One more thing.[AN]
Are you familiar with the[N]
saying "Murder is a Habit?"[AN]

[MidLeft]
I've not heard it before.[AN]
Does it mean once you[N]
kill enough people,[AN]
it becomes addicting...?[AN]

[MidRight]
No, not quite.[AN]
Once you've solved a[N]
problem through murder,[AN]
you'll try murder again[N]
to solve the next problem.[AN]
It's inevitable that we, as[N]
soldiers, need to kill people.[AN]
But not everything is solved[N]
through violence and killing.[AN]
Try to remember we kill out[N]
of necessity, and nothing more.[AN]

[MidLeft][MoveMidLeft]
I-I will![N]
Thank you, sir![A][2X][X]





#0x8E1 Chapter7BaseIsaacRemTalk

[MidRight][LoadRem][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Rem, Audrey told me you've[N]
helped us out quite a lot.[AN]

[MidRight]
What, did you think I'd[N]
run away or something?[AN]

[MidLeft]
You should have.[AN]
Nobody would blame[N]
you for running, Rem.[AN]
But you didn't.[AN]
You put in a lot[N]
of effort for us.[AN]
I'm deeply grateful,[N]
so... thank you.[AN]

[MidRight][HalfCloseEyes][Beat][AN][HalfCloseEyes]

[MidLeft]
...Is something wrong?[AN]

[MidRight][CloseEyes]
You just don't get[N]
it, huh, old man...[AN]
[OpenEyes]
Listen.[AN]
I've got a nice gig here.[AN]
I could care less about[N]
you and your silly crew.[AN]
You're "deeply grateful?"[N]
Don't make me laugh![AN]
If you want to thank me,[N]
how about a pay raise?![AN]
Bah![AN]
[ClearFace]

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heh...[A][2X][X]





#0x8FE Chapter7BaseSofiaBerkusTalk

[MidLeft][LoadBerkus][MidRight][LoadSofia]
Oh, Berkus![AN]
I'm glad you're alive...[N]
Are you doing alright?[AN]

[MidLeft]
...Actually, I'm in[N]
pretty rough shape.[AN]
That mine was a hellhole.[N]
I could use a checkup...[AN]

[MidRight][MoveLeft]
Let me take a look here...[AN]
[MoveLeft]
You seem to be suffering[N]
from some malnutrition...[AN]
And you're covered in lashes.[AN]
[ClearFace][MidRight][LoadSofia]
Here, I'll go and make[N]
you some food right away...[AN]
Just stay here and rest, okay?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, I will...[AN]
Sorry to have to[N]
trouble you, Sofia.[AN]

[MidRight]
N-no, it's okay.[AN]
I'm a medic,[N]
after all![A][2X][X]





#0xACB Chapter7BaseTitorJohnnyTalk

[Left][LoadJohnny][FarLeft][LoadTitor]
Squad leader Johnny![N]
This is private Titor.[AN]
Pretty girl, dead ahead![AN]
Requesting permission[N]
to head on in there![AN]

[Left]
That's a negative, Titor.[N]
Check your seven, partner.[AN]
That woman's loaded head to[N]
toe in expensive jewleries.[AN]
We ain't got the moolah.[AN]

[FarLeft]
B-but, squad[N]
leader Johnny...![AN]

[Left]
Whoa now, Titor, don't be hasty![N]
We got our whole lives still,[AN]
so don't go rushin' in there[N]
like a bull in a china shop.[A][2X][X]






#0x939 Chapter7BaseOlsonBrianTalk

[MidRight][LoadOlson][MidLeft][LoadBrian]
Well, hello there, Olson.[AN]
That's quite a fat wallet[N]
you seem to be carrying...[AN]
Have you perhaps struck[N]
it rich and not told us?[AN]

[MidRight][CloseEyes]
What are you going[N]
on about now, fool?[AN]
[OpenEyes]

[MidLeft]
Now now friend, I'm no fool![AN]
You seem well like a well[N]
prepared person, is all.[AN]
I've never been like that,[N]
so I'm rather impressed.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, well, I was an officer once.[AN]
I had to track my group's funds,[N]
and I didn't want to look a fool.[AN]
Even now, as a mercenary...[AN]

[MidLeft]
So that's it, then.[N]
But, what's this here?[AN]
It says... "Bolting"...[AN]
My, that's quite advanced[N]
magic, is it not, Olson?[AN]
I'd say an officer like you[N]
would make fine use of it.[AN]

[MidRight]
Wha...[AN]
[MoveMidRight]
You...! Give that[N]
back this instant![AN]

[MidLeft]
Haha, alright.[AN]
Calm down, now.[N]
It's but a jest.[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, fool, are you quite[N]
sufficiently amused, hmm?[AN]
Stealing from the officer when[N]
when he wasn't paying attention?[AN]
If you managed to steal from me,[AN]
then you must have quite[N]
the collection of stolen goods.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Was it so bad, friend?[AN]
Both of us should be[N]
rather relieved, I'd say.[AN]

[MidRight]
Relieved...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
That it was only[N]
your goods stolen,[AN]
and not your dreams.[AN]

[MidRight]
To return to Etruria[N]
as an officer...[AN]
Yeah, I won't let anyone[N]
steal that away from me.[AN]
[Smile]
Thanks, fool.[A][2X][X]





#0x8EE Chapter7BaseIsaacHermesTalk

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadHermes]
Oh, Commander![N]
Welcome back![AN]
Looking to[N]
buy something?[AN]

[MidRight]
...You really are[N]
here every time.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Of course![AN]
No such thing as a[N]
vacation for us merchants.[AN]
Well, then to business![AN]
You're looking for more[N]
quality goods today, hm?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, I need an[N]
easy to use shield.[AN]
Do you have anything[N]
of that sort today?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I've just the thing![AN]
Been holding on to[N]
it for you, in fact.[AN]
Though, it's rare,[AN]
so it may be a bit[N]
on the pricy side...[AN]

[MidRight]
Give it to me straight.[N]
How much are we talking?[AN]

[MidLeft]
For you...[N]
5,000 gold.[AN]

[MidRight]
Jeez.[AN]

[MidLeft]
It was a lot of trouble[N]
to take this, you know.[AN]
5,000 is on the cheap side.[AN]

[MidRight]
To take it...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Y-you just misheard that.[AN]
Ahem, well, how about it?[N]
Today's your only chance![A][2X][X]






#0xD43 Chapter7BaseJeronimoTalk

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadGeronimo]
I'm Geronimo, the recorder.[AN]
I'm in charge of recording[N]
everyone's Ranking.[AN]
I never expected you all to[N]
be taken away to those mines.[AN]
And while me and Hermes[N]
were out shopping, too...[AN]
We were shocked, but it[N]
looks like you're all okay.[AN]
Anyways, here's my evaluation.[A][2X][X]





#0x883 Chapter7BaseWorldMap

With help from the Resistance, Isaac[N]
and his mercenaries escape the mines,[AN]
taking refuge on a Resistance ship.[AN][Event]
The ship, now laden with escapee[N]
civilians, moves into the ocean.[AN][Event]
On the request of captain Geese,[AN]
the ship sets course from Dia to[N]
the port town of Russel.[AN][Event]
Meanwhile, word of the Eburacum[N]
escape reaches Etrurian mainland.[AN]
Etruria demanded to know the cause[N]
and for a counterplan to be enacted.[AN]
The officials in Juteaux,[N]
the capitol of Fibernia,[AN]
decided to send a priest from the[N]
St. Elimine Church to the people.[AN]
This facade was meant to ease[N]
the pain of their hard labor.[A][Event][2X][X]




#0x905 Chapter7BaseIsaacGraceTalk
[MidRight][LoadGrace][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Thanks for your help, Grace.[AN]
I heard you sent a letter[N]
to the St. Elimine Church.[AN]
Did you get a reply?[AN]

[MidRight]
No... I still haven't heard[N]
back. What will I do now...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
...Until then, you can stay with us.[AN]
I'd like you to continue working[N]
as a member of our mercenaries.[AN]
You'll be paid fairly, of course.[N]
Does that sound alright with you?[AN]

[MidRight]
Y-yes! I won't[N]
let you down![AN]

[MidLeft]
Just... don't go doing your[N]
own thing again, though.[AN]
Unless you want to sit through[N]
another of Audrey's lectures.[AN]

[MidRight]
Ah... hahaha...[A][2X][X]




#0xBA9 Chapter7BaseJoelTalk
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadJoel]
Whew, guess we can relax now.[AN]
I had come to this island since[N]
I heard about some treasure here,[AN]
but I never expected all this.[AN]
Jeez, talk about unlucky.[N]
Bahahaha!![AN]

[MidLeft]
So what are you going[N]
to do now, Sir Joel?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, let me think.[N]
[Beat][AN]
Could I join with you and[N]
your mercenary band for a while?[AN]
You're travelling around, right?[N]
Sounds perfect for a guy like me![AN]
[MoveMidRight]
PLEASE, ALLOW ME TO JOIN YOU!![AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes, of course.[AN]
I've listened to your yelling[N]
in the mines for quite some time,[AN]
So it'd be strange without it.[AN]

[MidRight][Smile]
Well, thank you!![AN]
If you want, I can yell for[N]
you whenever you want!!![AN]

[MidLeft]
Just be careful about when[N]
and where you're doing it...[A][2X][X]
