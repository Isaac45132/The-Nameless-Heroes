#0x882 Chapter4WorldMap
By order of Lord Florence of Dia,[N]
the mercenaries become scattered,[AN][Event]
and the men are sent to the Ebaracum[N]
mines on the central island, Fibernia.[AN][Event]
Life is strenuous there. The guards never[N]
allow the prisoners breaks from their work,[AN]
even if they are on the brink of collapse.[AN]
A hellscape where man after man fade away[N]
to skin and bones, and die of exhaustion.[AN]
One day, a guard approaches Isaac's cell,[N]
and offers to change the mercenaries' fate...[A][Event][X]

Huff... huff...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Hey, buddy, you alright?[AN]

[Left]
Cough, cough...[N]
I'm... fine.[AN]
I can't stop here...[AN]
If I do... everyone else in[N]
my room will be punished...[AN]
How are you holding up...?[AN]
You've been here[N]
two months, right?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Can't say I'm used to it.[AN]
I see my allies on occasion,[N]
but they look deathly...[AN]

[Left]
That would make sense...[AN]
The hellish labor conditions...[N]
We get so little time to rest...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Little to none, I'd say.[AN]
Do you really think[N]
they'll work us to death?[AN]

[Left]
I... I think so.[AN]
They will never let us free,[N]
rebellion is impossible...[AN]
My body is so weak...[N]
Urgh...[AN]
[ClearFace]

[FarLeft]
Hey... hey![AN]

[MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Hey! You! Number 62![N]
What are you doing?![AN]
Get the hell up![AN]
If you can't stand on your[N]
own... I'll have to make you![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight][Event]

[FarLeft][MoveMidLeft][MidLeft]
Stop.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh, Number 83? And just who the hell[N]
do you think you're speaking to, huh?![AN]
Piss off, you fucking scum![AN]
[MidRight][MoveMidRight][Event]

[MidLeft]
Urk...[AN]
[ClearFace]

[MidRight]

I'll keep whipping you![AN]

Looks like we'll have to[N]
bring in another replacement.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hey, Number 83! What the[N]
hell are you gawking at?![AN]
Do your damned job,[AN]

#0x964 Chapter4Opening2
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Finally, night...[N]
What a long day.[AN][CloseEyes][Beat][AN]

[MidRight][LoadGreenSoldier]
Psst, hey. You awake?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hm? You some kind of soldier?[AN][OpenEyes]
You've definitely got my attention,[N]
sneaking around this hellhole.[AN]
What do you want?[AN]

[MidRight]
Correct me if I'm wrong,[N]
but your name is Isaac, right?[AN]
Leader of a mercenary band?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Who are you, exactly?[N]
How do you know me?[AN]

[MidRight]
We have our ways of[N]
gathering information.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Not a fan of that answer...[AN]
In any case, me and my[N]
allies are locked up here.[AN]
There's not much I can do.[AN]

[MidRight]
Actually, on the contrary.[AN]
You being on the inside here[N]
is... beneficial for us.[AN]

[MidLeft]
...So, what do[N]
you need from me?[AN]

[MidRight]
We call ourselves the Resistance.[AN]
We're dealing with the Etrurian[N]
scourge you're all too familiar with.[AN]
We contacted you... your group,[AN]
rather, to inform you that mass riots[N]
are scheduled to occur in one hour.[AN]

[MidLeft]
And what does that have[N]
to do with me, exactly...?[AN]

[MidRight]
If you're interested in[N]
helping us with these riots...[AN]
we can bust you and[N]
your friends out of here.[AN]

[MidLeft]
So in other words,[N]
you want us to join in.[AN]

[MidRight]
Well said, sir Isaac.[AN]
You'll need to seize that security[N]
checkpoint - the throne, on your way.[AN]
The catch is we've only got ten[N]
hours. Think you're up to it?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sounds impossible.[AN]
The security around here[N]
is tighter than tight.[AN]
There's no way we could[N]
fight our way out unarmed.[AN]

[MidRight]
You underestimate our planning.[N]
The local troop is absent today.[AN]
They're on a mission out in Jutes.[AN]
As you might have noticed, it's been[N]
fairly easy for us to sneak around.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hm... alright.[N]
Count me in.[AN]
Better than rotting[N]
in this cell, anyways.[AN]

[MidRight]
A wise decision.[AN]
Here, I managed to get a key to[N]
this cell from the guard chambers.[AN]
I've also taken the liberty of[N]
delivering back your crew's belongings.[AN]
Good luck, friend.[A][X]






#0x95F Chapter4Opening3
[MidLeft][LoadYoungMan]

The time is soon.[N]
Just a little more...[AN]
And then, freedom![A][X]

Is it still not time...?[A][X]






#0x970 Chapter4Opening6
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
According to this map he gave me...[AN]
It seems the [Red]stairs towards[N]
the northwest [Red]are the exit.[AN]
But the only way to open the exit[N]
is through a switch on the throne.[AN]
Then, after I manage to [Red]seize the[N]
throne[Red], everyone needs to [Red]escape.[Red][AN]
[Red]I'll bring up the rear and go last.[Red][N]
It seems the riot begins in [Red]6 [Red]minutes.[AN]
After that, the guards will notice us.[AN]
I'll have to [Red]protect the civilians [Red]as well.[N]
Maybe I should [Red]talk to them[Red]...?[A][X]





#0x957 Chapter4TurnEvent
[MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier][MidRight][LoadDaniel]
You there! What the[N]
hell is going on?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sir Daniel![AN]
It seems that the[N]
prisoners are rioting.[AN]
If we can't stop them,[N]
the riots will only spread.[AN]

[MidRight]
And more importantly,[N]
they'll blame me...[AN]
Well, don't just stand there![N]
Call in more soldiers![AN]
Get the guard dogs as well![N]
Make sure no one escapes![AN]

[MidLeft]
Right, about the dogs...[AN]

[MidRight]
Bah, don't be[N]
such a coward.[AN]
They're trained[N]
not to attack us.[AN]
Heheheh...[AN]
Those fools will regret[N]
coming out of their cells,[AN]
only to be mangled and[N]
devoured by those mutts.[AN]
I'll stay here to[N]
command our troops.[AN]
You - after you get[N]
those reinforcements,[AN]
inform our men[N]
in Jutes right away.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sir, yes sir![AN]

Cocky fools... there is no escape![N]
You shall be our slaves until death![A][X]

easy to find a way in![AN]
This should be the place.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thanks, Rem.[AN]
According to what those[N]
"Resistance" people told us,[AN]
the riots should be[N]
starting just about now.[AN]

[Right]
I hope everyone's okay...[AN]

[MidLeft]
I wouldn't worry too much.[N]
We know them - they're strong.[AN]

[FarRight]
C'mon lady, you're about as[N]
coordinated as a druken sailor.[AN]

...Berkus? Is that you?[N]
You were imprisoned here, too?[AN]

[MidRight]
Sorry we didn't get a[N]
chance to tell you, boss.[AN]
We sent Chloe with[N]
the message for you,[AN]
and went on to our work...[AN]
But we ended up getting[N]
caught by Etrurian soldiers.[AN]
How the hell did you[N]
end up here anyways?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well, it's basically[N]
the same story.[AN]
At any rate, we're[N]
breaking out of here.[AN]

you to join us?[AN]

[MidRight]
Gahaha! You kiddin'?[N]

Boss! Hey! Now there's[N]
a sight for sore eyes.[AN]
Glad to see you,[N]
even in this shithole.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Good to see you too.[AN]
I almost missed[N]
your enthusiasm.[AN]
Almost.[AN]

[MidRight]
If I'm being honest,[AN]
putting up this smile[N]
has been pretty tough.[AN]
We've been stuck down[N]
here for quite a while.[AN]
I thought we were done for![AN]
Wait... how did you[N]
end up here exactly?[AN]
Don't tell me you got caught[N]
up with those Etrurians too?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Something like that. But[N]
I'm about done with it.[AN]
We're getting out of[N]
this hole right about now.[AN]

[MidRight]
Haha, you haven't changed[N]
one bit, you know that?[AN]
Don't worry boss, I'll[N]
still team up with ya.[AN]

[MidLeft]
We're starting a riot to escape[N]
this hole. Care to join us?[AN]

[MidRight]

I just want to go home...[AN]

[MidRight]
Are you here to[N]
help? Thank god...[AN]
The Resistance told[N]
me you would come.[AN]
Let me join you[N]
in the rioting![AN]
This opportunity only[N]
comes by once in a lifetime.[AN]

So... you're the ones[N]
leading the riot, eh?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, that's us. We'd[N]
appreciate your help.[AN]
It's gonna take a lot of[N]
us to get momentum going.[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm with you, then.[AN]
Rotting away in this cell[N]
isn't doing me any good.[AN]
If I'm destined to die here,[N]
I'm gonna die on my own terms.[AN]

Chloe is here too, and[N]
Sophia is on standby outside.[AN]
No way we were just[N]
going to leave you here.[AN]
You know that they say nobody[N]
comes back alive from Eberacum.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I thought I told you not[N]
to do anything reckless.[AN]
At least tell me[N]
you sent Kara back...[AN]

[MidRight]
Don't worry, I took care of her.[N]
Though it took a lot of persistance.[AN]
That girl... she wanted to come[N]
along on this mission too, you know.[AN]

[MidLeft]
At least she's safe.[AN]
So, what exactly is[N]
this mission, then?[AN]

[MidRight]
I assume that a Resistance[N]
member has already talked to you?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, they have.[AN]

[MidRight]
After they took you here,[AN]
we spoke with the Resistance and[N]
tried to figure out a way to rescue you.[AN]
The chance finally came, so here we are.[N]
I'm so relieved to see you safe...[AN]
Let's get out of here quickly.[AN]

haven't seen a woman in ages,[AN]
and it's stuffy and cramped...[AN]
screw this place! It's time for[N]
our grand quest for freedom![AN]

[MidLeft]
Shut your hole, you moron.[AN]

Let's get out of here[N]
while we have the chance![AN]
[ClearFace]

[LoadCaptain]
With this many people...[N]
we can get out![AN]
[ClearFace]

[MidLeft]
Looks like the riot is[N]
going according to plan.[AN]
Now we just need to head[N]
to the exit ourselves.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadGreenSoldier]
Seems everything went well, then.[AN]

[MidLeft]
We managed, somehow.[N]
So we're good to go?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, the exit is just up that way.[N]
The area is pretty densely guarded,[AN]
but there's less guards than usual.[N]
With this many people... should be fine.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I hope you're correct, then.[AN]

[MidRight]
We'll attempt to control the riots.[N]
You can focus on getting out of here.[A][X]






#0x955 Chapter4Ending2
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadAudrey]
We should move on, Isaac.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right. Once we're past[N]
here, we'll be at the exit.[AN]
I won't miss this hellhole.[AN]
So, what exactly happened[N]
while we were gone?[AN]

[MidRight]
We were at quite a loss,[AN]
when the Resistance came[N]
to us and offered to help.[AN]
There was nowhere else to[N]
turn, so of course we accepted.[AN]

[MidLeft]
This Resistance... they[N]
claim to fight for the people.[AN]
To be liberators.[AN]

[MidRight]
That's right. Seems their activity is[N]
mostly inolving bandits and the Etrurians.[AN]

[MidLeft]
The Etrurians, huh? I see.[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm told that since they're outside[N]
the scope of their home country's rule,[AN]
they've taken to...[N]
Less morally acceptable methodologies.[AN]
Using their iron fist to oppress and[N]
cooperating with bandits for profits.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Tsk, the greedy bastards.[AN]
This Resistance leader must be pretty[N]
strong to go up against such people.[AN]

[MidRight]
Well... she's...[N]
I mean, the leader is...[AN]

[MidLeft]
So it's a woman, huh? She[N]
must be quite a spectacle.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, she is.[AN]
She has a lot of charisma,[N]
and the strength to match.[AN]
She holds the whole operation together,[AN]
and she's been resisting the[N]
Etrurians for quite some time.[AN]
They call her the "Hero of the West."[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's quite a title.[AN]
And we owe her our lives as well.[N]
I'll have to give her my graditutes.[AN]

[MidRight]
You can thank her all you[N]
want once we get out of here.[AN]
Let's get going![AN]

[MidLeft]
Right. I'll lead the way.[A][X]

I guess I'll go too...[AN]

[MidRight][LoadGreenSoldier]
Hey! Wait![AN]

[MidRight][LoadAudrey]
This is getting out of hand.[AN]
Looks like this mission[N]

[MidLeft]
Ah, so you've arrived![AN]
Sir Galius, you have a strong[N]
recommendation from Sir Roartz.[AN]
I would love to see what[N]
you are capable of firsthand.[AN]

[MidRight][LoadGalius]
Of course, Sir Arcard.[AN]
It would be my pleasure to serve[N]
the "King" of the Western Isles.[AN]

[MidLeft]
King... Ahaha! I like the sound of that.[N]
I think I'll use that from now on...[AN]
By the by, I'm told some remnants of the[N]
Nameless may be on this island somewhere.[AN]
Is that true?[AN]
Are those bastards holding some kind of[N]
grudge against me for decieving them?[AN]
What do you think, Sir Galius?[AN]

[MidRight]
I am certain they are present,[N]
though their motive is unclear.[AN]
However, allow me to handle[N]
them for you, Sir Arcard.[AN]
That is, after all,[N]
one of the reasons I am here.[AN]
Me and my associates can[N]
handle those fools, and you...[AN]
you can focus on your governance.[AN]
You and Sir Roartz hold[N]
the future in your hands.[AN]
I and the Schwarzritter[N]
can handle the dirty work.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I see, I see...[AN]
I'll leave it in your[N]
capable hands then, Sir Galius.[A][X]

Looks like we're all accounted[N]
for. Let's start the briefing.[AN]

[Right]
Huh? Where exactly are we?[AN]

[MidLeft]
The is the Guide Corner.[N]
Don't think about it too hard.[AN]

[FarRight]
So, commander, what are we to do?[AN]

[MidLeft]
For starters, it's a good idea[N]
to stay put until help arrives.[AN]
Don't run out of your cells[N]
into the darkness, lest you die.[AN]

[FarRight]
I don't have a way to[N]
leave by myself anyways...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Also, after [Red]6 rounds [Red]of combat,[AN]
riots will begin. We can expect that[N]
more enemies will come to greet us.[AN]
Afterwards, they'll be calling their hounds.[N]
From [Red]rounds 7 through 9, [Red]they'll rush in.[AN]

[Right]
H-hounds?![AN]

[MidLeft]
They're military trained.[N]
They can [Red]move and attack quickly.[Red][AN]
We should be sure to keep our guards up.[AN]
In addition, it seems that reinforcements[N]
will approach when we reach certain areas.[AN]
[Red]The gate to the left [Red]is a safe bet.[AN]

[FarRight]
It seems dangerous[N]
to move carelessly.[AN]

[MidLeft]
On the [Red]fourth round,[Red][AN]
Audrey and the others[N]
will come help us.[AN]
After that we should be[N]
okay to start our escape.[AN]

[Right][ClearFace][LoadWolf][FarRight][ClearFace][LoadBrian]

[Right]
So boss, it looks like we[N]
have more allies locked up.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Seems so. Leave talking to them to me.[N]
I can [Red]speak to the civilians [Red]as well.[AN]

[FarRight]
There seems to be some[N]
strange sword in my cell...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Try searching around it.[N]
There may be something of use.[AN]

[FarRight]
Hoho! Well, that kind[N]
of job is my speciality.[AN]

[MidLeft]
We should stay vigilant for more[N]
[Red]suspicious areas [Red]in the future...[AN]
Anyways, that gate up top won't[N]
open for a key or lockpick.[AN]

This might sound dumb, but...[N]
How exactly do we escape?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Just head up the stairs.[N]
The escape area is marked.[AN]
Once you enter it,[N]
you'll be able to escape.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alright! I think we're good to go.[AN]

[MidLeft]
One last thing. The civilains[N]
are essential for our riot.[AN]
If we let [Red]more than one die,[Red][N]
we won't be able to proceed.[AN]

[MidRight][MoveRight][FarRight][LoadEdmund]
Alright! Let's all[N]
escape together, everyone![AN]

[MidLeft]
Let's get ready![A][X]

I'll treat everyone's wounds![A][X]
