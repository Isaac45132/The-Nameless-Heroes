[MidRight][LoadGreenSoldier][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
[Beat][AN]
Fresh air at last...[N]
It's been a long time.[AN]

[MidRight]
Now we all need to escape[N]
to the southwest coast.[AN]
We'll probably be met with[N]
some harsh resistance here.[AN]
Brace yourselves, friends.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Of course.[AN]
Let's carry[N]
out our mission.[AN]

[MidRight]
We're counting on you.[AN]
I need to go gather[N]
up the civilians,[AN]
so we part ways here.[AN]
I'll leave the[N]
rest in your hands.[AN]

[ClearFace][LoadAudrey]
Isaac, everyone is ready.[AN]
We need to protect[N]
these people, huh...[AN]
How long do you think[N]
we'll need to hold out?[AN]

[MidLeft]
[CloseEyes][Beat][.....][OpenEyes]I have no idea.[AN]
We have the Resistance helping[N]
us, but that's anyone's guess.[AN]
What I do know is that[N]
we owe them our freedom.[AN]
That's why we need to try[N]
our damndest to help them.[AN]

[MidRight]
For you and the Resistance,[N]
I'll do my best as well.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Good. It's nice to know that[N]
we're all on the same page.[AN]
Once we've escorted all[N]
the prisoners to safety,[AN]
We need to [Red]escape[Red][N]
from the southern fort.[AN]
I can't... no, I won't[N]
allow any sacrifices.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alright. The Resistance said[N]
the boat will be waiting there.[AN]
We'll let them handle the rest.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Then it's time.[N]
Mercenaries, move out![A][2X][X]




#0x9A5 Chapter6Opening2

[MidLeft][LoadNuma][MidRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Commander Numa.[AN]
We've discovered a group ahead[N]
that we believe to be the fugitives.[AN]
They seem to be trying to make[N]
a run for the southeastern coast.[AN]
We'll begin our pursuit immediately.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Very well. If they don't obey[N]
our orders, you may kill them.[AN]
Hmph, those Eburacum scum...[N]
They've made us quite a ruckus.[AN]
They must have known that our[N]
troop was out at the time...[AN]
What fools. They've escaped[N]
right back into our spears.[AN]

[MidRight]
It seems that the Resistance[N]
is involved in their escape.[AN]
I'm afraid they have some[N]
kind of setup here...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Huh, the Resistance?[AN]
They seem to be rallying[N]
with some "Hero of the West".[AN]
If it's them here, then...[AN]
That "Hero" person[N]
must be here as well.[AN]
Be sure to find her and[N]
capture her - alive.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alive...?[AN]
But sir, shouldn't we[N]
execute her on the spot?[AN]
If we let her live, then...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Use your head.[AN]
These Resistance fighters all[N]
see this person as an icon.[AN]
Suppose we catch her alive and[N]
then execute her publicly.[AN]
It'll destroy their morale.[AN]

[MidRight]
I see...[AN]

[MidLeft]
So, get a move on![AN]

[MidRight]
Yes, sir![A][2X][X]




#0x9A6 Chapter6Opening3

[MidLeft][LoadGingerMan][MidRight][LoadGreenSoldier]
We'll guide you to[N]
the safe zone, alright?[AN]
Whatever happens,[N]
keep close to us.[AN]
And if anything[N]
happens to us...[AN]
Just run straight for[N]
the southeastern fort.[AN]
Don't go looking back.[AN]
I promise you'll be in[N]
good hands there.[AN]

[MidLeft]
R-right. [CloseEyes]Deep breaths.[.....][OpenEyes][N]
We're all gonna be fine.[A][2X][X]




#0x9A7 Chapter6Opening4

[FarLeft][LoadKara][Left][LoadSofia][MidRight][LoadEchidna]
Okay gang, it's time.[AN]
Those prisoners will[N]
be coming here any moment.[AN]
Remember, focus on our[N]
mission, you got that?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Roger that![N]
Leave it to me![AN]

[Left]
[CloseEyes][Beat][.....][OpenEyes][N]
...U-um, right![AN]

[MidRight]
Kara, you're[N]
energetic...[AN]
Per usual.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Thanks, heheh...[AN]

[MidRight]
That wasn't supposed[N]
to be a compliment...[AN]
And, Sofia, you look[N]
completely exhausted.[AN]
I don't think I've seen[N]
you take a single break.[AN]
I know you feel obligated[N]
to heal us with your staves,[AN]
but you're of no use if[N]
you're falling asleep on us.[AN]
Take some time to rest,[N]
you've definitely earned it.[AN]

[Left]
...Huh...?[N]
No... I'm alright.[AN]
A lot of people have[N]
been suffering...[AN]
I want to help them[N]
as soon as I can...[AN]

[MidRight]
Listen to yourself, girl.[N]
You can barely speak to me.[AN]
Don't you think you're[N]
overdoing it here?[AN]

[Left]
I'll get some rest once[N]
the mission is over, so...[AN]
Please, let me help you.[N]
I really must...[AN]

[MidRight]
[CloseEyes]...[.....][OpenEyes]Alright, fine.[AN]
But the moment we're done here,[N]
I'll carry you to bed if I have to.[AN]

[Left]
Ah, thank you[N]
very much, ma'am![AN]

[ClearFace][LoadJester]
Miss Echidna! Emergency![N]
Pirates...! The pirates are...![AN]

[MidRight]
Whoa, whoa. Easy, kid.[N]
What's this about pirates?[AN]

[Left]
Uh, well...[AN]

[FarFarRight]
Echidna! Please come quickly![AN]
It's pirates! Pirates have[N]
started showing up onshore![AN]

[MidRight]
Well, damn. Talk about[N]
bad timing, am I right?[AN]
Alright, I'll head over[N]
there and fend them off.[AN]
If that ship goes down,[N]
we're about as good as dead.[AN]
Jester, lead the others and[N]
deal with the situation here.[AN]

[Left]
R-right! Leave it to us![N]
We fight for justice![AN]

[MidRight]
And don't you all go dying[N]
on me, you got that? Now go![A][2X][X]





#0x9B2 Chapter6Ending

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadEchidna]
So, you finally showed up, huh?[AN]
What a slowpoke! You're late,[N]
so hurry it up and get onboard![AN]

[MidLeft]
...Are you the so-called[N]
"Hero of the West"?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, I'm told people call me that.[N]
Didya need something from me?[AN]

[MidLeft]
The Resistance has helped us a lot.[AN]
As the leader of my mercenaries,[N]
I'd like to express our gratitudes.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hah! Well, don't worry about it.[N]
Besides, we owe you our thanks too.[AN]
You saved our arses back there.[AN]
Say, you lot are pretty tough...[N]
Have you considered joining us?[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'm grateful for the invitation,[N]
but we've already decided to leave.[AN]
I'm afraid we'll be parting ways.[AN]

[MidRight]
Ah, I'm sorry to hear that.[N]
Taking a better look at you...[AN]
You don't seem to be from around[N]
here, so that's a smart move.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I have to put our safety first.[N]
...I hope you can understand.[AN]

[MidRight]
Not a problem here.[AN]
The Resistance ain't a popular[N]
group to be joining anyways...[AN]
Well, if we do meet again,[N]
maybe you'll change your tune.[AN]
Oh, I almost forgot. My name[N]
is Echidna. And you are...?[AN]

[MidLeft]
My name is Isaac.[N]
[ToggleSmile]It's a pleasure.[AN][ToggleSmile]

[MidRight]
Well, Isaac... I'll remember[N]
your name. And what you did here.[AN]
And remember, we're always open.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I'd be happy to help if[N]
the opportunity comes.[A][Clear][2X][X]





#0x9AC Chapter6Ending2

[MidLeft][LoadJester][MidRight][LoadEchidna]
Hey, Jester! Good to see[N]
you made it out okay.[AN]
I was worried since you're[N]
always going off about...[AN]
Justice, was it? But you[N]
ain't seen much fighting.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Geez, I can handle[N]
myself, you know![AN]

[MidRight]
Uh-huh... not sure[N]
I really believe that.[AN]
Didn't you get a lot[N]
of help out there?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well I...[.....][AN]
wait, were you[N]
watching me?[AN]

[MidRight]
Hah! No, I just had something[N]
of a hunch, honest, Jester.[AN]
You got a little sister, right?[AN]
I don't care what you start[N]
yelling on the battlefield,[AN]
but remember to think about[N]
the people back at home.[AN]
Personally, I'd say you'd want[N]
to get back as soon as you can.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Well... we got into a bit of[N]
fight since I've seen her, but...[AN]
I can't stop fighting just yet.[AN]
It's for her... no, for[N]
everyone on the island.[AN]
That's what my justice is.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alright, well, I can't force ya.[AN]
Just remember, if you go out there[N]
and get yourself killed, well...[AN]
I don't think anyone wants to[N]
be telling your sister about it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
[CloseEyes][Beat][.....][N][OpenEyes]
Yeah, I know.[AN]
But anyways, miss Echidna...[N]
Why did you call me out here?[AN]

[MidRight]
Ah, right. Jester, I want you to[N]
stick with Isaac's group for now.[AN]

[MidLeft]
With them? Why?[AN]

[MidRight]
Somebody's gotta guard that boat.[AN]
Not like the other ships don't[N]
have anyone looking after them.[AN]
Besides, might do you some good[N]
to work with the mercenaries.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hm...[AN]
Well, if you[N]
say so, then.[AN]

[MidRight]
If you want to fight for your justice,[N]
you're gonna need to toughen up, kid.[AN]
You can head on back once everything's[N]
cleaned up. And don't get reckless.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Understood![A][Clear][2X][X]




#0x9AD Chapter6Ending3

[FarLeft][LoadKara][Left][LoadSofia][MidRight][LoadEchidna]
Ah, Kara. Looks like[N]
you made it out okay.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Yeah! I saw commander[N]
and the mercenaries too![AN]

[MidRight]
Commander...?[AN]
Oh, you mean[N]
that Isaac fellow?[AN]

[FarLeft]
That's right! Did you[N]
talk to him, Echidna?[AN]

[MidRight]
I did, if only a little.[N]
He seems tough as nails.[AN]
If we had a hardened veteran[N]
like him on our side, well...[AN]
Things would be a lot[N]
easier for us, eh?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Isaac is really tough![N]
And reliable too![AN]

[MidRight]
I can tell he's helped[N]
you guys through a lot.[AN]

[FarLeft]
You think so?[AN]

[MidRight]
Call it a gut feeling.[AN]
Anyways, you two are[N]
free to go join him.[AN]
The ship's over there.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Alright![AN]
...Um, I know it's only[N]
been a little while,[AN]
But thank you for[N]
everything you've done![AN]
[ClearFace]

[MidRight]
Hah, take care, girl.[AN]
Now, Sofia. I guess[N]
you're going too?[AN]

[Left]
Yes, I am. Thank you for[N]
taking care of us, Echidna.[AN]

[MidRight]
It goes both ways, kid.[N]
You saved plenty of lives.[AN]
Make sure to look after[N]
Isaac and the mercenaries.[AN]

[Left]
Yes, I will![N]
Thank you again![AN]

[MidRight]
The men will be sad to[N]
hear you're going, though.[AN]

[Left]
H-huh?[AN]

[MidRight]
Hahah, it's nothing.[AN]
Remember to look after[N]
yourself too, got it?[A][2X][X]




#0x9B3 Chapter6Ending4

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadGeese]
Oi, mate! Ya gettin' used ta[N]
bein' out on the water?[AN]

[MidRight]
This ship is very large, and well[N]
built, so I think I'll be alright.[AN]
Are you alright with this, though?[AN]
I'm told this is usually a cargo[N]
ship, and a well-earned one too.[AN]
It seems like harboring refugees[N]
would be quite troublesome for you.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Ar, well, about that.[AN]
What would ya think if[N]
I said we're pirates?[AN]

[MidRight]
...Are you?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hahah, no. Don't be givin'[N]
me such a frightened face.[AN]
We ain't quite like that.[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, I don't see how you'd[N]
benefit from having us either way.[AN]
Is there some profit in this?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Nothin' like that. A while ago, we were[N]
workin' transport for merchant ships.[AN]
But as of late, Bern's been startin'[N]
up their silly little war, and well...[AN]
Business went straight to the water.[AN]
We tried to take up pirateerin' but[N]
we ended up bein' awful pirates. Hah![AN]
In the end we're back to our old ways.[AN]

[MidRight]
That explains the size of the ship.[N]
It really is a merchant's ship, huh.[AN]

[MidLeft]
We're part of a merchant's[N]
guild over in Bulgar...[AN]
Have ya heard o' it?[AN]
We've got a reputation to[N]
uphold, so you can trust us.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, I've heard of it.[AN]
I didn't expect even you would[N]
need to resort to piratery though.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Crazy, ain't it. Business is tough[N]
all over these blasted islands.[AN]
Well anyways, lad, we're gonna[N]
be anchoring in Russel first.[AN]
We got plenty o' cargo to drop[N]
off down at 'er port below deck.[AN]
After that we'll take ya straight[N]
to yer destination. That alright?[AN]

[MidRight]
That's not a problem. We'll[N]
take care of guard duty, then.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Perfect. Me and my men[N]
can't fight worth nuts.[AN]
It's a four day sail from[N]
here, so take it easy.[AN]

[MidRight]
Four days, huh...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hah! That's right.[AN]
Think you'll get tired[N]
o' seein' my ugly mug?[AN]

[MidRight]
[ToggleSmile]Heh, something[N]
like that.[AN][ToggleSmile]

[MidLeft]
Gahaha! Can't blame ya.[N]
Four days ain't enough,[AN]
but I'll make ya see the[N]
real beauty of the sea.[AN]
You'll see, lad! Ha![AN]

[MidRight][Beat][AN]

[FarFarLeft]
Heyyyy! Can you[N]
hear meeeee!?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Someone's hollerin'.[N]
Is it at us...?[AN]

[MidRight]
Ah, it's...[A][2X][X]




#0x95D Chapter6Ending5

[MidLeft][LoadEchidna]
Heeeey![N]
Can ya hear meee?![AN]
Looks like we're[N]
about to take off![AN]
Don't forget to[N]
keep in touch![AN]
Take care, lad![A][2X][X]




#0x95C Chapter6Ending6

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadGeese]
Heh, looks like[N]
somebody's popular.[AN]
Are ya as good as[N]
she makes ya seem?[AN]

[MidRight]
You could say that.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Guess we've got nothin'[N]
ta worry about, then.[AN]
Well, I've got some[N]
work ta be doin' now.[AN]
Oh, and before I[N]
forget ta mention it...[AN]
If ya feel sick,[N]
try ta hurl overboard.[AN]
Don't want ta be moppin'[N]
up your mess. Gahaha![AN]
Bon voyage, friend.[AN]

[MidRight]
Uh, right.[N]
Thanks.[A][2X][X]




#0xE3B Chapter6Ending7

[MidRight][LoadGalius][MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
Commander Galius![N]
The area is under control.[AN]
We've purged any resistance,[N]
as per your orders, sir.[AN]
We've also received some[N]
reports about the Nameless...[AN]

[MidRight]
Gwahahaha! Well done.[N]
Those Nameless dotards...[AN]
Seems they've been working[N]
with that Resistance here.[AN]
Well now, was anyone[N]
needlessly violent today?[AN]

[MidLeft]
No, sir. Our troop[N]
was well behaved.[AN]

[MidRight]
Excellent. As professionals,[N]
we have standards to uphold.[AN]
I don't need those who...[AN]
indulge themselves in[N]
gratuitous violence around.[AN]
We must properly represent[N]
the glory of Etruria.[AN]
Now then, sorry to[N]
keep you waiting, ma'am.[A][2X][X]




#0xE3C Chapter6Ending8

[MidLeft][LoadGalius][FarRight][LoadLoli][Right][LoadKelikGirl][HalfCloseEyes]
No, no...[AN]
Don't come[N]
any closer![AN]

[MidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Heheh. Don't be afraid now.[AN]
My name is Galius, commander[N]
of the Schwarzritter.[AN]
Ma'am, I have a...[N]
favor to ask of you.[AN]
That is why we kept you and[N]
your child alive, after all.[AN]
Little miss, everyone is dead,[N]
except for you and your mother.[AN]
Do you know why that is, hmm?[AN]

[FarRight]
H-huh?[AN]

[MidLeft]
It's because they gave harbor to[N]
the Resistance and worked with them.[AN]
Do you understand, little one?[N]
I would like you to remember this.[AN]
After all, we wouldn't want[N]
something like this to happen again.[AN]

[Right]
What do you want from us?[N]
Please, don't hurt us![AN]

[MidLeft]
Whoa, whoa. Hold on there, ma'am.[AN]
We are honorable knights. I would[N]
never do something so... barbaric.[AN]
I believe you've seen enough[N]
violence today, don't you agree?[AN]
Men, release these women.[A][2X][X]





#0xE3D Chapter6Ending9

[MidRight][LoadGalius][MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir... why did[N]
we let them go?[AN]

[MidRight]
It's simple, my boy. How can a[N]
story be told with no teller?[AN]
And I'm sure those two will[N]
be telling such a nice story.[AN]
Perhaps for the rest of[N]
their little lives... Gahaha![AN]
Alright, let's get a move on.[AN]
We must report the prescence[N]
of the Nameless, posthaste.[A][2X][X]





#0x5C Chapter6Guide

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][MidLeft][LoadWrys]
Allow me to instruct you for[N]
the next mission, as usual.[AN]

[MidRight]
Someone's eager today.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's what the Guide Corner[N]
is here for, after all.[AN]
Without further ado...[AN]
For this mission, you'll have[N]
[Red]20 rounds [Red]to escape the field.[AN]

[MidRight]
There aren't many enemies on[N]
the way to the escape point.[AN]
It almost seems too easy...[AN]

[MidLeft]
You'd be correct.[AN]
Naturally, there will be[N]
reinforcements appearing.[AN]
Bandits will be coming down[N]
from the path in the upper right.[AN]
And if [Red]three [Red]civilians are[N]
killed, the mission is a failure.[AN]
They'll be escaping from the fort's[N]
gate, so be sure to protect them.[AN]

[MidRight]
That will be quite difficult.[AN]
We'll need to fend off the[N]
Etrurians from the left, too.[AN]
I might need to split our party.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Alongside the bandits, their[N]
leader will be appearing as well.[AN]
I'm sure you know of[N]
your personal skill, Intimidate?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, it can lower the[N]
evasion of any enemies nearby.[AN]
This is going to be difficult.[AN]
I want to have my sword wielding[N]
allies deal with those brigands,[AN]
but they typically don't have[N]
much in the way of endurance.[AN]
I'll need to carefully consider[N]
where to send everyone here.[AN]

[MidLeft]
That would be wise. Did you[N]
see the group in the lower left?[AN]

[MidRight]
The enemy formation there[N]
seems very tough to crack.[AN]

[MidLeft]
The group surrounding the commander[N]
will charge you around the [Red]11th round.[Red][AN]
So, you don't need to head all[N]
the way down there to face them.[AN]
In fact, more enemies may start[N]
appearing, so it's best not to.[AN]

[MidRight]
In that case,[AN]
we should head for the exit[N]
once all the civilians are safe.[AN]
We'll need to fend off both[N]
the Etrurians and the bandits...[AN]
It'll be tough, but we'll[N]
have to grin and bear it.[AN]
Thanks for the advice.[A][2X][X]

Looks like these runaways 'ave[N]
got a pretty bounty on 'er heads.[AN]
Heheheh, this job'll be easier[N]
'an taking candy from a baby.[AN]
Them Etrurian blokes a'ways[N]
give us the easiest work.[AN]
We should thank 'em, eh?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, I guess yer right![AN]
Those Resistance folk[N]
are a bunch of civs.[AN]
Ain't no match for us![AN]
'Course we'd be scared[N]
real good if that...[AN]

were here, huh?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Bahh, what's to be 'fraid of?[AN]
He ain't no Hero, probably[N]
just got lucky is all.[AN]
When people are outta hope,[N]
they look real hard for it.[AN]
Nothin' ta worry about, boy.[AN]

You're obviously out of your element.[AN]

[MidRight]
Ah...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Luckily I was able to stop you,[N]
but who knows about next time?[AN]
That's all I'm trying to say.[N]
Watch yourself out there, kid.[AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight]
Is he on my side...?[A][2X][X]





#0x98C Chapter6IsaacSofiaTalk

[MidRight][LoadSofia][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Sofia...[AN]
I'm glad you're[N]
alright, too.[AN]

[MidRight]
Is that you... Isaac?[N]
It's good to see you again.[AN]
I'm sorry I didn't make[N]
it back to you sooner.[AN]

[MidLeft]
No, it's alright. You were[N]
just doing what you needed to.[AN]
Looks like you've been running[N]
yourself ragged helping out...[AN]
As you always do.[AN]

[MidRight]
...This is the best I can do.[AN]
After Berkus and the[N]
others were taken away,[AN]
I tried telling them it was[N]
some kind of mistake, but...[AN]
In the end, I was somehow[N]
able to get help here,[AN]
from the Resistance.[AN]
So I've been fighting with them[N]
hoping to meet up with Audrey.[AN]
I've been trying to treat[N]
their wounded, and...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sofia, you're clearly exhausted.[AN]
I know how you are, but you really[N]
need to look after yourself as well.[AN]

[MidRight]
Echidna just told me the[N]
same thing a moment ago.[AN]

[MidLeft]
She's that hero I'm told about?[AN]
I guess I'm not the only one who[N]
thinks you work yourself too hard.[AN]

[MidRight]
You think so...?[AN]
Well anyway, I'll[N]
join back up with you.[AN]
I'd like to help everyone[N]
by healing their wounds...[AN]
After all, I don't want[N]
any more people to die.[AN]

[MidLeft]
As long as you don't[N]
overdo it, Sofia.[A][2X][X]





#0x98D Chapter6Village1

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadMoneyMan]
Sorry, but... I can't allow fugitives[N]
from Eberacum into our village.[AN]
Who knows what would happen to us[N]
if they found you hiding here?[AN]
I know you've had it hard, but[N]
we just want to live in peace...[AN]
Please, take this and leave.[A][2X][X]





#0x98E Chapter6Village2

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadOldMom]
Oh, hello.[N]
Did you come to see me dance?[AN]
I'm sorry, but I just finished[N]
a few moments ago.[AN]
Oh, by the way... Would you be interested[N]
in one of these items?[AN]
A wealthy patron left me a small ransom[N]
in gifts after watching my performance.[AN]
You can sell one for gold if you'd like[N]
or use them to improve your skills.[AN]
I simply cannot carry all of this by[N]
myself, so please, take this one.[AN]
Wealth is useless if you can't use it[N]
to bring happiness to others, right?[AN]
Thanks for dropping by. Perhaps we'll[N]
meet again someday.[A][2X][X]




#0x98F Chapter6Village3

[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadOldMan]
In my youth, I was a knight of some[N]
renown, I'll have you know.[AN]
I've even crossed blades with one of[N]
Etruria's most famous generals, I have.[AN]
Ah, but I'm an old man now...[AN]
I'm starting to worry... What if I die[N]
without passing on my techniques?[AN]
So I decided to write down what I've[N]
learned in a book. I have it here.[AN]
You seem like a strong warrior. I'd[N]
be honored if you would accept it.[A][2X][X]





#0x984 Chapter6NumaCharge

[MidLeft][LoadNuma]
What are you waiting[N]
for, you wimps?[AN]
All right, then...[AN]
I'll lead the[N]
charge! After me![A][2X][X]
