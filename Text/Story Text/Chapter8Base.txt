Four days after driving off Zot's pirates,[AN]
the ship finally arrived at the Fibernian[N]
port, Deil, with the passengers aboard safe.[AN][Event]
The mercenaries were relieved to finally[N]
set foot on dry land after a long voyage.[AN]
However, the sick bard had grown more ill.[AN]
Geese asked Isaac for his help, and they[N]
begun to search for someone to treat him.[AN][Event]
A Resistance member onboard suggested they[N]
join up with the Resistance in town.[AN][Event]
With their help, they found a safe place[N]
for the bard to rest and recover his ails.[AN]
Two days later, just as the mercenaries[N]
were finishing preparations to leave Deil,[AN][Event]
roars and screams echoed through the town.[AN]
It was not until then they realized that[N]
this place was anything but a safe haven.[A][2X][X]

Oh, hello, hello![N]
Come in, commander.[AN]
I've worked hard to procure[N]
some fine items for you today![AN]

[MidRight]
Procure...?[AN]
These are stolen[N]
goods again, huh?[AN]

[MidLeft]
W-whoa whoa! Hey now![AN]
Don't be ridiculous,[N]
these aren't stolen goods.[AN]
I'm running an honest[N]
to god business here.[AN]
Well then, what kind of item[N]
are you looking for today?[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm looking for a physic staff.[AN]
With that we can fight while[N]
keeping our healers safe.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Of course I have one, but...[N]
maybe you should think grander?[AN]
I've an even more potent staff here.[AN]
It has the amazing ability to heal[N]
everyone in a radius around you.[AN]

[MidRight]
A fortify staff, is it?[N]
Gotta be expensive...[AN]

[MidLeft]
On the contrary![N]
For you, a mere 4500 gold.[AN]
And, I'll throw in that physic[N]
staff you wanted, no charge![AN]

[MidRight]
...Okay, these have[N]
to be stolen, right?[AN]

[MidLeft]
It's not![N]

[FarLeft][LoadLarum][Left][LoadLizzy][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
How is Sir Elffin? He was[N]
still quite ill, right?[AN]

[Left]
His seizures have just[N]
started settling down.[AN]
But, he seems to be[N]
getting worse by the day.[AN]
At this rate, he'll...[AN]

[FarLeft]
No! Don't say it...[N]
I'm sure he will...[AN][CloseEyes]
Elffin will...[AN][OpenEyes]

[Left]
Y-you're right.[N]
Sorry, Larum...[AN]

[MidRight]
[Beat][AN]
Together with Geese's crew,[AN]
we're looking for somewhere[N]
he can be properly treated.[AN]
It shouldn't be too long.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Um, Mr. Isaac...[AN]
Do you think he's[N]
going to be alright?[AN]

[MidRight]
I have no idea.[N]
I'm not much for medicine.[AN]
What I do know is that we're[N]
all going to try our damndest.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Yeah...[N]
Thank you.[AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight]
She's taking it[N]
pretty badly, huh.[AN]

[Left]
I can't blame her.[N]
He keeps getting worse...[AN]
Our hopes for his recovery[N]
seem to be dwindling...[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm going to go[N]
out searching again.[AN]

[Left]
I'll join you.[A][2X][X]

[MidLeft][LoadLizzy][MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Lizzy, that sword and shield...[N]
They look rather valuable.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hm? Oh, these?[AN]
They've been passed down in[N]
my family for generations.[AN]
You won't believe it,[AN]
but it's said that when the[N]
sword and shield are combined,[AN]
it creates a legendary blade.[AN]
Apparently, it can control time.[AN]
But, I think that's just all[N]
fairy tales and folklore, right?[AN]

[MidRight]
I know you trust me,[AN]
but don't go telling that[N]
to any random stranger.[AN]
You're likely to get mugged.[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft]
...What did he[N]
mean by that?[A][2X][X]

about her?[AN]

[MidLeft][OpenEyes]
...Audrey.[AN]
What makes[N]
you think that?[AN]

[MidRight]
You've often been absorbed[N]
in thought since we met her.[AN]
Everyone understands...[N]
After all, we were there too.[AN]
That's why we all follow[N]
you, Isa... no, commander.[AN]

You're being a pest![N]
How irritating![AN]

How old are you, Ms. Audrey?[AN]
What's your favorite food?[N]
How fast does your race grow?[N]
Do you sleep as long as us?[N]

Sir Isaac![AN]

[MidRight]
Jester. We'll be parting[N]
ways in this coming town.[AN]
I wish you the best of luck[N]
back in the Resistance.[AN]
And remember, getting yourself[N]
killed will gain you nothing.[AN]
Do your best to keep on living.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Y-yeah! Thank you very much![N]
Oh, I had something to ask...[AN]
You're looking for somewhere to[N]
treat that entertainer, right?[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, that's right.[AN]
We're trying every venue, but[N]
we've still had no luck yet.[AN]
It's a sad world where no inn[N]
lets a dying man get some rest.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I have an idea. How about[N]
you ask the Resistance?[AN]

[MidRight]
The Resistance?[AN]
Well, they might help,[AN]
but is it really that[N]
easy to contact them?[AN]
They're not necessarily[N]
even in this town.[AN]

[MidLeft]
It's certainly true[N]
that you can't usually.[AN]
But, I'm a Resistance member.[N]
I'll try to see what I can do.[AN]
We have something like...[N]
Our own set of signals.[AN]

[MidRight]
I'll leave it[N]
to you, then.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Roger that![N]
I'll do my best![A][2X][X]
