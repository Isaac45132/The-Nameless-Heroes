[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadCaptain]
If the waters keep cooperatin',[N]
I'd say we've got about...[AN]
half a day left ta go.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I apologize, Captain.[AN]
Having your boat sailed right into pirate[N]
territory must have been worrisome.[AN]

[MidRight]
Tis' fine. 'Sides, with[N]
pirates roamin' around,[AN]
we've got a fat nothing[N]
in the way of business.[AN]
Also, the people of this[N]
town helped us a'fore,[AN]
so we're jus'[N]
returnin' the favor.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Glad that you think so,[N]
but here comes trouble...[AN]

[MidRight]
What's wrong?[AN]

[MidLeft]
It's a ship, Captain.[N]
It's trying to come alongside us.[AN]

[MidRight]
Damn, they must've[N]
been hiding in the fog.[AN]
Hrm... it seems to be[N]
bearin' Etrurian colors.[AN]
Is it a patrol ship?[N]
Whadda they want from us?[A][2X][X]





#0x93B Chapter3Opening2

[MidRight][LoadSchwartz]
This is a patrol ship[N]
from the Kingdom of Etruria.[AN]
Stop your ship, and[N]
bring your captain to me.[A][2X][X]





#0x928 Chapter3Opening3

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadCaptain]
Sounds like they're callin' me.[N]
It's not a big deal.[AN]
Wait down below deck, an'[N]
I'll deal with this lot.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Captain, is this a[N]
common occurrence?[AN]

[MidRight]
No, tis' the first time.[AN]
The whole blasted continent[N]
is up in smoke these days,[AN]
so I guess them Etrurian[N]
guard types are bucklin' down.[AN]
This misunderstandin' should[N]
be cleared up right quick.[AN]

[MidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][2X][X]





#0x94C Chapter3Opening4

[Right][LoadSchwartz][FarLeft][LoadCaptain]
I'm the cap'n here. What seems[N]
to be the problem, officer?[AN]

[Right]
My name is Schwartz, and I'm the chief[N]
naval officer of the Etrurian guards.[AN]
Could I investigate this vessel, please?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Eh? Why? What are[N]
we suspected of?[AN]

[Right]
I agree that this is[N]
certainly sudden, so I'm sorry.[AN]
We overheard news that pirates[N]
are lurking in this area,[AN]
so we're investigating.[N]
I hope you understand.[AN]

[FarLeft]
What? Do we look like pirates?[AN]

[Right]
I'm just making sure.[AN]
Pirates these days are very[N]
keen when it comes to disguises.[AN]

[FarLeft]
If that's the case...[AN]
then that sounds[N]
reasonable, I s'pose.[AN]

[Right]
I thank you for your cooperation.[AN]
Alright, everyone, we're good to go.[AN]
Men, begin loading their[N]
cargo onto the ship![AN]

[FarRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Yes sir! We'll go and[N]
get everything ready.[AN]
[Clear]

[FarLeft]
Hang on a moment![AN]
I've never heard of Etrurian[N]
guards doing such things![AN]

[Right]
We're only taking the cargo back[N]
to our base and investigating it.[AN]
When it comes to an investigation,[N]
we always make a thorough one.[AN]
Or, is there something shady[N]
you're trying to hide from us?[AN]

[FarLeft]
That's not it...[AN]
If ya take all our cargo away,[N]
the business'll get stalled![AN]

[FarRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir Schwartz,[N]
everything's ready.[AN]

[Right]
Good. Do it.[AN]

[FarRight]
Yes sir![AN]
[Clear]

[FarLeft][Clear][Left][LoadCaptain]
Hey![AN]
What the hell is[N]
goin' on here?![AN]
Stop doing that![AN]
Don't ruin me ship![AN]

[Right]
Huh? What are you doing[N]
with your hands?[AN]

[Left]
What?[AN]

[Right]
Don't touch me with your[N]
dirty, commoner hands![AN]

[Left][Clear][FarLeft][LoadCaptain]
Huh?![AN]

[Right]
This act can be seen as a sign[N]
of rebellion against Etruria![AN]

[FarLeft]
Hey, what the hell?! I only[N]
touched ya fer a moment![AN]

[Right]
Damn rebels! You[N]
deserve swift justice![AN]

[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Hey, calm down![A][2X][X]





#0x94D Chapter3Opening5

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
This is becoming[N]
a bad situation...[A][2X][X]





#0x94E Chapter3Opening6

[MidRight][LoadSchwartz][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Captain! Are you OK?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well well, what[N]
do we have here?[AN]
Seems to be a group[N]
of mercenary rabble.[AN]
Hey! That ship is[N]
property of the rebels.[AN]
We are confiscating it, so[N]
you must all vacate the boat![AN]

[MidLeft]
We're in the middle of the ocean.[AN]
And there are a lot of[N]
civilians below deck.[AN]
What exactly are we supposed to do?[AN]

[MidRight]
Jump into the water, of course.[AN]
We'll help you do it,[AN]
if you would be so kind as to[N]
gather everyone on the deck.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thanks, but I think[N]
we'll pass on that.[AN]

[MidRight]
My men work under the banner of justice.[N]
Which means you are obstructing justice.[AN]
As a knight, I cannot overlook that.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yet you, "as a knight", would find fault[N]
where there is none with our captain,[AN]
steal his ship, and his supplies?[AN]
Seems like something a pirate would do.[AN]

[MidRight]
You would dare compare[N]
us to pirates!?[AN]

[MidLeft]
A pirate under a knightly[N]
banner is a pirate all the same.[AN]

[MidRight]
You... you lowly mercenaries![N]
Soldiers, kill those lowborns![AN]
Get ready to kill everyone on that ship![AN]
It's a grave crime to insult me -[N]
no, to insult the Etrurian knights![AN]
Your death shall not be quick![A][2X][X]





#0x92E Chapter3Opening7

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][FarLeft][LoadPirate]
Captain![.....][AN]
Hey, mercenaries, we'll[N]
take care of the cap'n.[AN]
Can you keep 'em from[N]
comin' into our ship?[AN]

[MidRight]
We'll try our best. But I have[N]
something to ask of you, sailor.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Sadly, we're mostly[N]
trained fer cargo...[AN]
But, I'll listen to[N]
yer request, at least.[AN]

[MidRight]
Is it possible to pierce[N]
the enemy's commanding ship?[AN]
Unless something happens,[N]
the enemy won't withdraw.[AN]
We can't keep fighting[N]
forever. Can you do it?[AN]

[Left][LoadCaptain]
We can...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Captain! Please don't overdo[N]
it! Yer still injured![AN]

[Left]
Ya... idiot...[AN]
Now's the time[N]
to overdo it...[AN]
You... explain it.[AN]

[FarLeft]
R-right. We're sailors.[N]
We know a lot about most ships.[AN]
We should be able to fire on 'er[N]
commandin' ship and burst a hole innit,[AN]
without 'er noticin'.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alright, then we'll keep them distracted[N]
on the decks as long as possible.[AN]

[FarLeft]
I'll leave it to ya...[N]
Now, let's retreat, cap'n![A][2X][X]





#0x950 Chapter3RemSpawn

[MidLeft][LoadRem]
Ah, thank goodness![AN]
At last, there's a[N]
chance for me to escape![AN]
Hell, I busted into this ship,[AN]
but since it set sail,[N]
I've been in trouble.[AN]
Oh well, time to scram![A][2X][X]

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Hey, you![AN]
Where the hell[N]
are you going?[AN]

[MidRight][LoadRem][CloseEyes]
(Damnit, I got caught. I'll[N]
have to play it off somehow.)[AN]
Thank goodness you're here, sir.[AN]
The people on this ship stole me away...[N]
I barely escaped with my life...[AN]
*sniffle*[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sounds like a load of crap.[AN]
I can see all the valuables you're[N]
trying to hide under your cloak.[AN]
So, if I got it right...[AN]
You busted into this ship[N]
to make off with their stuff,[AN]
But then you realized there[N]
was no way to get off the boat...[AN]
Is that it?[AN]

[MidRight][OpenEyes]
S-so what! I'm[N]
barely getting by![AN]
Yeah I steal,[AN]
but it's not like[N]
I can afford to care![AN]

[MidLeft]
I understand that, but you[N]
can't go on like that forever.[AN]
It'll catch up to you[N]
someday, girl.[AN]
Lucky for you, I'm busy,[N]
so that day's not today.[AN]

[MidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]

[MidLeft]
Alright then, now get out of[N]
here, before you get hurt.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hey... can I... come with you?[N]
You folk are mercenaries, right?[AN]
You're telling me to change my[N]
ways, so maybe you can help me.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You understand that our work[N]
is dangerous, don't you?[AN]

[MidRight]
Of course I know that![N]
And so is mine.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Very well. I suppose I can allow it,[N]
if only because I admire your gall.[AN]
Just make sure to follow my orders.[AN]

[MidRight]
Of course, sir![A][2X][X]

Stop pickpocketing,[AN]
or you'll find yourself[N]
in an unfortunate situation.[AN]

[Right]
You, a thief, telling[N]
me to stop thieving?[AN]
You've gotta be[N]

I've gotta complain about[N]

You must have been a noble![AN]
Unable to maintain your land,[N]

You dirty Etrurian minions...[AN]

#0x94A Chapter3Ending1

[MidRight][LoadSchwartz]
Tsk... These lowly[N]
mercenaries are troublesome.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
Commander Schwartz![AN]
The enemy has blown a hole[N]
in the hull of our ship![AN]
If we continue this[N]
battle, we'll be sunk![AN]

[MidRight]
What?! When in the world did[N]
they do such a thing?! Argh![AN]
Humiliated by a bunch[N]
of lowly mercenaries...[AN]
Damnit, it can't be helped...[N]

#0x956 Chapter3Ending3
[Left][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadAudrey]
Seems like the fight is over.[N]
Those Etrurians are retreating.[AN]

[Left]
We managed, but...[AN]
I didn't expect them to be committing[N]
crimes under the mantle of authority.[AN]
What is happening around here?[AN]

[MidRight]
It was definitely strange. They[N]
acted like they could do no wrong.[AN]

[MidRight][Clear][FarLeft][LoadAudrey][MidRight][LoadCaptain]
Ah, hell...[AN]
You mean ta' say[N]
you don't know?[AN]

[Left]
Captain?[N]
How is your wound?[AN]
And, do you know something[N]
about those Etrurians?[AN]

[MidRight]
My wound is far from all right...[AN]
Anyways, rumors are goin' round 'bout[N]
the Eburacum Mines, down on Fibernia.[AN]
Men from all over are bein' taken[N]
down there by force... as slaves.[AN]
They work 'em to skin and bones, 'til[N]
they die. That's how the rumor goes.[AN]
People started callin' em[N]
the "Death Mines of Eburacum."[AN]

[FarLeft][Beat][AN]

[Left][Beat][AN]

[MidRight]
Personally I thought it[N]
was a load o' hogwash...[AN]
But after seein' those[N]
men actin' like that...[AN]
I'm startin' ta change me mind.[A][2X][X]





#0x931 Chapter3Ending4
[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadAudrey]
It looks like there's finally hope[N]
for the reconstruction of Valetta.[AN]
They have a fascinating ability[N]
to hold on to their lives...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Seems so. I think we've cleared out[N]
all the pirates in the area, at least.[AN]
I can't help but feel we're taking[N]
a bit too much pay from these people.[AN]
Can they really afford to be paying us[N]
when their homes are in shambles?[AN]

[MidRight]
I think it's alright. Besides,[N]
if they really are cleared out,[AN]
then we can finally earn a rest.[AN]
Anything is better than what we had[N]
to go through back in Etruria, anyways.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I suppose you're right.[AN]

[MidRight]
By the way, Isaac...[AN]
What's with those sheets of[N]
paper you're shuffling around?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, these? They're for[N]
Kara. It's a certification.[AN]
While we were fighting those pirates,[N]
I was evaluating her performance.[AN]
She was doing great, even though[N]
I can't quite shake my worries...[AN]
If she submits these, she can become[N]
a fully-fledged pegasus knight.[AN]
...That of course means she[N]
would have to fly to Ilia.[AN]
I think we'd all miss her.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, if Kara left...[AN]
It would definitely[N]
be an emotional goodbye.[AN]
I think we all have[N]
a soft spot for her.[AN]

[MidLeft]
She might leave, but it's not[N]
like she'd be gone forever.[AN]
I'm sure we'd see each other again.[AN]
Anyways, I've already finished[N]
up with writing the thing.[AN]
I'll have to find a good[N]
occasion to present it to her.[AN]
Of course, not if she[N]
keeps insisting that I do.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh? I guess she'll never[N]
get it at this rate.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hah! Right you are.[N]
But, I can't help but wonder...[AN]
Johnny and the others have[N]
been gone far too long.[AN]
Chloe says it's because they[N]
have another mission, but...[AN]

[MidRight]
I agree. We haven't heard so[N]
much as a thing from them...[AN]
You don't think something[N]
bad happened to them?[AN]

[MidLeft]
That sounds likely...[AN]

[Event]
[FarRight]
Heeelp! It's Etrurians![N]
They're here in the village![AN]

[MidLeft]
More trouble, sounds like.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah. Are they out for[N]
revenge against us?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Whatever the case, it seems serious.[AN]
Go gather everyone. Looks like we[N]
have another fight on our hands.[AN]

[MidRight]
Right, I'll go get them now.[A][2X][X]



#0x932 Chapter3Ending5

[Left][LoadMoneyMan][MidRight][LoadDaniel]
Listen well, people of this village![AN]
I come bearing orders[N]
from Lord Florence of Dia![AN]
Lord Florence has given you[N]
the honor of serving Etruria,[AN]
for which you should take great pride![AN]
Any able bodied men from 15 to 60 years[N]
of age shall present themselves now![AN]
You may not veto this decision![AN]
If there should be anyone who refuses[N]
this duty, we shall punish this village![AN]
Expect harsh sanctions![AN]

[Left]
Oh, gods no...[N]
It's the end...[AN]
They'll send us to the[N]
Death Mines of Eburacum...[AN]
They'll work us until[N]
there's nothing left...[AN]

[Left][Clear][LoadIsaac]
So, it looks like the[N]
rumors were true...[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadAudrey]
I've gathered everyone here Isaac,[N]
but... there are so many soldiers here![AN]
No matter how hard we fight, we[N]
could never defeat this many, right?[AN]

[Left]
It seems they're not here for a fight...[AN]
But it looks like we have no choice[N]
but to comply and go to Eburacum.[AN]

[FarLeft]
To those death mines?[AN]

[Left]
Yeah... This is a bad situation.[AN]
Like you said, there's far too[N]
many of them for us to handle,[AN]
and we were caught off guard.[AN]
I can't see a reasonable[N]
escape route anywhere, either.[AN]

[FarLeft]
I guess you're right... damnit.[N]
So then what should we do?[AN]

[Left]
Here. Take these papers, and give[N]
them to Kara. Tell her to flee to Ilia.[AN]
We can't look after her any longer.[N]
I'm sure she'll be fine on her own.[AN]

[FarLeft]
I never thought I'd be[N]
the one giving this to her...[AN]

[Left]
Me neither. I have one last request, Audrey.[N]
Please, look after the girls for me.[AN]
I'm sorry I can't be of more use...[AN]

Uh... pardon?[N]
You know what, nevermind.[AN]
Please start us off, mister[N]

[MidLeft]
Leave it to me.[AN]
The goal of this mission is to[N]
defend for as long as possible.[AN]
But, if we can [Red]defeat their[N]
commander, [Red]the troops will scatter.[AN]

[MidRight]
There's a lot of enemies[N]
right up next to us...[AN]
Maybe we should keep back.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Watch out then, lass.[AN]
If you defeat an[N]
enemy as they attack,[AN]
it leaves room for[N]
more to come swingin'.[AN]
The soldiers in particular[N]
seem pretty damn reckless.[AN]
On the [Red]fourth round [Red]of combat,[AN]
seems like another ship is[N]
gonna pull up from behind us.[AN]

[MidRight]
That priest with that ship...[AN]
He can't seem to be able to[N]
reach anybody. What's he doing?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Looks like he's carryin' one of[N]
those there [Red]long range magicky books...[Red][AN]
Maybe we can have Kara take care[N]
of him... and [Red]take his equipment.[Red][AN]

[MidRight]
That seems like a good idea.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Lastly, I'll tell you[N]
about their commander.[AN]
To beat that slim-eyed punk,[AN]
you'll have to go and[N]
[Red]approach pretty quickly,[Red][AN]
lest we run outta time.[AN]
He's a tough one, so[N]
[Red]be careful [Red]when fightin' him.[AN]

[MidRight]
I think I have a plan.[N]
Thanks, Mr. Best Mercenary...[AN]
