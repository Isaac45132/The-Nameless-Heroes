#0x94B Chapter3Opening

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadCaptain]
If the waters keep cooperatin',[N]
I'd say we've got about...[AN]
half a day left ta go.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I apologize, Captain.[AN]
Having your boat sailed right into pirate[N]
territory must have been worrisome.[AN]

[MidRight]
Tis fine. 'Sides, with[N]
pirates roamin' around,[AN]
we've got a fat nothing[N]
in the way of business.[AN]
Also, the people of this[N]
town helped us afore,[AN]
so we're jus'[N]
returning the favor.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Glad that you think so,[N]
but here comes trouble...[AN]

[MidRight]
What's wrong?[AN]

[MidLeft]
It's a ship, Captain.[N]
It's trying to come alongside us.[AN]

[MidRight]
Shit, they must've[N]
been hiding in the fog.[AN]
Hrm... it seems to be[N]
bearin' Etrurian colors.[AN]
Is it a patrol ship?[N]
Whatta they want from us?[A][X]





#0x93B Chapter3Opening2

[MidRight][LoadSchwarz]
This is a patrol ship[N]
from the Kingdom of Etruria.[AN]
Stop your ship, and[N]
bring your captain to me.[A][X]





#0x928 Chapter3Opening3

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadCaptain]
Sounds like they're callin' me.[N]
It's not a big deal.[AN]
Wait down below deck, an'[N]
I'll deal with this lot.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Captain, is this a[N]
common occurrence?[AN]

[MidRight]
No, tis' the first time.[AN]
The whole blasted continent[N]
is up in smoke these days,[AN]
so I guess them Etrurian[N]
guard types are bucklin' down.[AN]
This misunderstandin' should[N]
be cleared up right quick.[AN]

[MidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[A][X]





#0x94C Chapter3Opening4

[Right][LoadSchwarz][FarLeft][LoadCaptain]
I'm the cap'n here. What seems[N]
to be the problem, officer?[AN]

[Right]
My name is Schwarz, and I'm the chief[N]
naval officer of the Etrurian guards.[AN]
Could I investigate this vessel, please?[AN]

[FarLeft]
Eh? Why? What are[N]
we suspected of?[AN]

[Right]
I agree that this is[N]
certainly sudden, so I'm sorry.[AN]
We overheard news that pirates[N]
are lurking in this area,[AN]
so we're investigating.[N]
I hope you understand.[AN]

[FarLeft]
What? Do we look like pirates?[AN]

[Right]
I'm just making sure.[AN]
Pirates these days are very[N]
keen when it comes to disguises.[AN]

[MidLeft]
If that's the case...[AN]
then that sounds[N]
reasonable, I s'pose.[AN]

[Right]
I thank you for your cooperation.[AN]
Alright, everyone, we're good to go.[N]
Men, begin loading their[N]
cargo onto the ship![AN]

[FarRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Yes sir! We'll go and[N]
get everything ready.[AN]
[Clear]

[FarLeft]
Hang on a moment![AN]
I've never heard of Etrurian[N]
guards doing such things![AN]

[Right]
We're only taking the cargo back[N]
to our base and investigating it.[AN]
When it comes to an investigation,[N]
we always make a thorough one.[AN]
Or, is there something shady[N]
you're trying to hide from us?[AN]

[FarLeft]
That's not it...[AN]
If ya take all our cargo away,[N]
the business'll get stalled![AN]

[FarRight][LoadRedSoldier]
Sir Schwarz,[N]
everything's ready.[AN]

[Right]
Good. Do it.[AN]

[FarRight]
Yes sir![AN]
[Clear]

[FarLeft][Clear][Left][LoadCaptain]
Hey![AN]
What the hell is[N]
goin' on here?![AN]
Stop doing that![AN]
Don't ruin me ship![AN]

[Right]
Huh? What are you doing[N]
with your hands?[AN]

[Left]
What?[AN]

[Right]
Don't touch me with your[N]
dirty, commoner hands![AN]

[Left][Clear][FarLeft][LoadCaptain]
Huh?![AN]

[Right]
This act can be seen as a sign[N]
of rebellion against Etruria![AN]

[FarLeft]
Hey, what the hell?! I only[N]
touched ya fer a moment![AN]

[Right]
Damn rebels! You[N]
deserve swift justice![AN]

[FarLeft][MoveFarLeft]
Hey, calm down![A][X]





#0x94D Chapter3Opening5

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
This is becoming[N]
a bad situation...[A][X]





#0x94E Chapter3Opening6

[MidRight][LoadSchwarz][MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Captain! Are you OK?[AN]

[MidRight]
Well well, what[N]
do we have here?[AN]
Seems to be a group[N]
of mercenary rabble.[AN]
Hey! That ship is[N]
property of the rebels.[AN]
We are confiscating it, so[N]
you must all vacate the boat![AN]

[MidLeft]
We're in the middle of the ocean.[AN]
And there are a lot of[N]
civilians below deck.[AN]
What exactly are we supposed to do?[AN]

[MidRight]
Jump into the water, of course.[AN]
We'll help you do it,[AN]
if you would be so kind as to[N]
gather everyone on the deck.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thanks, but I think[N]
we'll pass on that.[AN]

[MidRight]
My men work under the banner of justice.[N]
Which means you are obstructing justice.[AN]
As a knight, I cannot overlook that.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yet you, "as a knight", would find fault[N]
where there is none with our captain,[AN]
steal his ship, and his supplies?[AN]
Seems like something a pirate would do.[AN]

[MidRight]
You would dare compare[N]
us to pirates!?[AN]

[MidLeft]
A pirate under a knightly[N]
banner is a pirate all the same.[AN]

[MidRight]
You... you lowly mercenaries![N]
Soldiers, kill those bastards![AN]
Get ready to kill everyone on that ship![AN]
It's a grave crime to insult me -[N]
no, to insult the Etrurian knights![AN]
Your death shall not be quick![A][X]





#0x92E Chapter3Opening7

[MidRight][LoadIsaac][FarLeft][LoadPirate]
Captain![.....][AN]
Hey, mercenaries, we'll[N]
take care of the cap'n.[AN]
Can you keep 'em from[N]
comin' into our ship?[AN]

[MidRight]
We'll try our best. But I have[N]
something to ask of you, sailor.[AN]

[FarLeft]
Sadly, we're mostly[N]
trained fer cargo...[AN]
But, I'll listen to[N]
yer request, at least.[AN]

[MidRight]
Is it possible to pierce[N]
the enemy's commanding ship?[AN]
Unless something happens,[N]
the enemy won't withdraw.[AN]
We can't keep fighting[N]
forever. Can you do it?[AN]

[Left][LoadCaptain]
We can...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Captain! Please don't overdo[N]
it! Yer still injured![AN]

[Left]
Ya... idiot...[AN]
Now's the time[N]
to overdo it...[AN]
You... explain it.[AN]

[FarLeft]
R-right. We're sailors.[N]
We know a lot about most ships.[AN]
We should be able to fire on 'er[N]
commandin' ship and burst a hole innit,[AN]
without 'er noticin'.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alright, then we'll keep them distracted[N]
on the decks as long as possible.[AN]

[FarLeft]
I'll leave it to ya...[N]
Now, let's retreat, cap'n![A][X]





#0x950 Chapter3RemSpawn

[MidLeft][LoadRem]
Ah, thank goodness![AN]
At last, there's a[N]
chance for me to escape![AN]
Hell, I busted into this ship,[AN]
but since it set sail,[N]
I've been in trouble.[AN]
Oh well, time to scram![A][X]





#0xA71 Chapter3RemIsaacTalk

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac]
Hey, you![AN]
Where the hell[N]
are you going?[AN]

[MidRight][LoadRem][CloseEyes]
(Damnit, I got caught. I'll[N]
have to play it off somehow.)[AN]
Thank goodness you're here, sir.[AN]
The people on this ship stole me away...[N]
I barely escaped with my life...[AN]
*sniffle*[AN]

[MidLeft]
Sounds like a load of crap.[AN]
I can see all the valuables you're[N]
trying to hide under your cloak.[AN]
So, if I got it right...[AN]
You busted into this ship[N]
to make off with their stuff,[AN]
But then you realized there[N]
was no way to get off the boat...[AN]
Is that it?[AN]

[MidRight][OpenEyes]
S-so what! I'm[N]
barely getting by![AN]
Yeah I steal,[AN]
but it's not like[N]
I can afford to care![AN]

[MidLeft]
I understand that, but you[N]
can't go on like that forever.[AN]
It'll catch up to you[N]
someday, girl.[AN]
Lucky for you, I'm busy,[N]
so that day's not today.[AN]

[MidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][AN]

[MidLeft]
Alright then, now get out of[N]
here, before you get hurt.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hey... can I... come with you?[N]
You folk are mercenaries, right?[AN]
You're telling me to change my[N]
ways, so maybe you can help me.[AN]

[MidLeft]
You understand that our work[N]
is dangerous, don't you?[AN]

[MidRight]
Of course I know that![N]
And so is mine.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Very well. I suppose I can allow it,[N]
if only because I admire your gall.[AN]
Just make sure to follow my orders.[AN]

[MidRight]
Of course, sir![A][X]

[MidRight][LoadBrian]
Hmm? That girl looks like...?[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadRem][MoveLeft]
Hey, you! Can you[N]
get outta my way?![AN]
If you didn't notice,[AN]
I'm barely escaping[N]
with my life here![AN]

[MidRight]
My apologies. You should be[N]
able to go that way, miss.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, thanks, bub.[AN]

[MidRight][Clear][Left][MoveFarRight][Left][LoadBrian]
Hey, little miss![N]
Hold a moment![AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadRem]
What is it?! Can't you[N]
see I'm in a hurry?![AN]

[Left]
I see you were holding some[N]
extravagant looking wares.[AN]
You're a thief, are you not?[AN]

[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Hey![AN]

[MoveRight]
Those are mine![N]
Give them back![AN]

[Left]
Of course, of course.[N]
There you are, miss.[AN]

[Right][MoveRight]
Hmph![AN]

[Left]
A piece of advice,[N]
one thief to another.[AN]
Stop pickpocketing,[AN]
or you'll find yourself[N]
in an unfortunate situation.[AN]

[Right]
You, a thief, telling[N]
me to stop thieving?[AN]
You've gotta be[N]
joking with me![AN]
Where's your boss?![AN]
I've gotta complain about[N]
you, or I can't settle down![AN]
The nerve! Urgh![AN]
[Clear]

[Left]
Hey, miss! Don't go that way![AN]
You could get hurt! Hey![AN]

Shut it already, fatso![A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadSchwarz]
Tsk, what an annoyance.[AN]
My armor will get sullied...[N]
With your blood![A][X]





#0x91A Chapter3SchwarzIsaacBossQuote

[MidLeft][LoadSchwarz]
Considering you're[N]
a lowly mercenary,[AN]
your armor looks refined.[AN]
And, your sword technique...[AN]
It's Etrurian![AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
Your point?[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft][LoadSchwarz]
You're pitiful...![AN]
You must have been a noble![AN]
Unable to maintain your land,[N]
you degraded to a mercenary![AN]
I can't think of a word more[N]
suitable for you than pitiful![AN]
[Clear]

[MidRight][LoadIsaac]
I'm not joining you[N]
in stalling for time.[AN]
[Clear]

[MidLeft][LoadSchwarz]
Hehehe...[N]
Ahahaha![AN]
For the honor of Etruria,[AN]
a pitiful man like yourself[N]
shall die by my hand![AN]

I'll see you try.[A][X]

Now I see...[N]
That black armor...[AN]
You dirty Etrurian minions...[AN]
The Nameless...[A][X]





#0x94A Chapter3Ending1

[MidRight][LoadSchwarz]
Tsk... These lowly[N]
mercenaries are troublesome.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadRedSoldier]
Commander Schwarz![AN]
The enemy has blown a hole[N]
in the hull of our ship![AN]
If we continue this[N]
battle, we'll be sunk![AN]

[MidRight]
What?! When in the world did[N]
they do such a thing?! Argh![AN]
Humiliated by a bunch[N]
of lowly mercenaries...[AN]
Damnit, it can't be helped...[N]
Men! Full retreat![AN]
Get her out of here![AN]

[MidLeft]
Yes, sir![AN]

[MidRight][MoveMidRight]
Shit![AN]

Damnit![AN]
When we meet again,[N]
mercenaries...[AN]
I'll make you pay![A][X]





#0x951 Chapter3Ending2

Listen to me, soldiers![AN]
Your general is defeated,[N]
so this fight is now pointless![AN]

[MidLeft][LoadIsaac][MidRight][LoadAudrey]
It looks like there's finally hope[N]
for the reconstruction of Valetta.[AN]
They have a fascinating ability[N]
to hold on to their lives...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Seems so. I think we've cleared out[N]
all the pirates in the area, at least.[AN]
I can't help but feel we're taking[N]
a bit too much pay from these people.[AN]
Can they really afford to be paying us[N]
when their homes are in shambles?[AN]

[MidRight]
I think it's alright. Besides,[N]
if they really are cleared out,[AN]
then we can finally earn a rest.[AN]
Anything is better than what we had[N]
to go through back in Etruria, anyways.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I suppose you're right.[AN]

[MidRight]
By the way, Isaac...[AN]
What's with those sheets of[N]
paper you're shuffling around?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, these? They're for[N]
Kara. It's a certification.[AN]
While we were fighting those pirates,[N]
I was evaluating her performance.[AN]
She was doing great, even though[N]
I can't quite shake my worries...[AN]
If she submits these, she can become[N]
a fully-fledged Pegasus Knight.[AN]
...That of course means she[N]
would have to fly to Illia.[AN]
I think we'd all miss her.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah, if Kara left...[AN]
It would definitely[N]
be an emotional goodbye.[AN] 
I think we all have[N]
a soft spot for her.[AN]

[MidLeft]
She might leave, but it's not[N]
like she'd be gone forever.[AN]
I'm sure we'd see each other again.[AN]
Anyways, I've already finished[N]
up with writing the thing.[AN]
I'll have to find a good[N]
occasion to present it to her.[AN]
Of course, not if she[N]
keeps insisting that I do.[AN]

[MidRight]
Oh? I guess she'll never[N]
get it at this rate.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Hah! Right you are.[N]
But, I can't help but wonder...[AN]
Johnny and the others have[N]
been gone far too long.[AN]
Chloe says it's because they[N]
have another mission, but...[AN]

[MidRight]
I agree. We haven't heard so[N]
much as a thing from them...[AN]
You don't think something[N]
bad happened to them?[AN]

[MidLeft]
That sounds likely...[AN]

[Event]
[FarRight]
Heeelp! It's Etrurians![N]
They're here in the village![AN]

[MidLeft]
More trouble, sounds like.[AN]

[MidRight]
Yeah. Are they out for[N]
revenge against us?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Whatever the case, it seems serious.[AN]
Go gather everyone. Looks like we[N]
have another fight on our hands.[AN]

[MidRight]
Right, I'll go get them now.[A][X]



#0x932 Chapter3Ending5

[Left][LoadMoneyMan][MidRight][LoadSaar]
Listen well, people of this village!
I come bearing orders
from Lord Florence of Dia!
Lord Florence has given you 
the honor of serving Etruria,
for which you should take great pride!
Any able bodied men from 15 to 60 years
of age shall present themselves now!
You have may not veto this decision!
If there should be any one who refuses
this duty, we shall punish this village
through harsh sanctions!

[Left]
Oh, gods no...
It's the end...
They'll send us to the
Death Mines of Eburacum...
They'll work us until
there's nothing left...

[Left][Clear][LoadIsaac]
I'd heard about this, but...
I never believed it to be true.

[FarLeft][LoadAudrey]
I've gathered everyone here Isaac,
but... there are so many soldiers here!
No matter how hard we fight, we
could never defeat this many, right?

[Left]
It seems they're not here for a fight...
But it looks like we have no choice
but to comply and go to Eburacum.

[FarLeft]
To the mines?

[Left]
Yeah... This is a bad situation.
Like you said, there's far too
many of them for us to handle,
and we were caught off guard.
I can't see a reasonable
escape route anywhere.

[FarLeft]
I guess you're right... damnit.
So then what are we going to do?

[Left]
Here. Take these papers, and give 
them to Kara. Tell her to flee to Illia.
We can't look after her any longer.
I'm sure she'll be fine on her own.

[FarLeft]
I never thought I'd be
the one giving this to her...

[Left]
Me neither. I have one last request, Audrey.
Please, look after the girls for me.
I'm sorry I can't be of more use...

[FarLeft]
...

[MidRight]
Hear hear, men of the village!
Gather to the town square!
Quickly, now!

[FarLeft]
Isaac, I...

[Left]
Thank you for taking care of me, 
Audrey. May the gods light your path.
...Goodbye.
