[Left][LoadMoneyMan][MidRight][LoadSaar]
Listen well, people of this village!
I come bearing orders
from Lord Florence of Dia!
Lord Florence has given you 
the honor of serving Etruria,
for which you should take great pride!
Any able bodied men from 15 to 60 years
of age shall present themselves now!
You have may not veto this decision!
If there should be any one who refuses
this duty, we shall punish this village
through harsh sanctions!

[Left]
Oh, gods no...
It's the end...
They'll send us to the
Death Mines of Eburacum...
They'll work us until
there's nothing left...

[Left][Clear][LoadIsaac]
I'd heard about this, but...
I never believed it to be true.

[FarLeft][LoadAudrey]
I've gathered everyone here Isaac,
but... there are so many soldiers here!
No matter how hard we fight, we
could never defeat this many, right?

[Left]
It seems they're not here for a fight...
But it looks like we have no choice
but to comply and go to Eburacum.

[FarLeft]
To the mines?

[Left]
Yeah... This is a bad situation.
Like you said, there's far too
many of them for us to handle,
and we were caught off guard.
I can't see a reasonable
escape route anywhere.

[FarLeft]
I guess you're right... damnit.
So then what are we going to do?

[Left]
Here. Take these papers, and give 
them to Kara. Tell her to flee to Illia.
We can't look after her any longer.
I'm sure she'll be fine on her own.

[FarLeft]
I never thought I'd be
the one giving this to her...

[Left]
Me neither. I have one last request, Audrey.
Please, look after the girls for me.
I'm sorry I can't be of more use...

[FarLeft]
...

[MidRight]
Hear hear, men of the village!
Gather to the town square!
Quickly, now!

[FarLeft]
Isaac, I...

[Left]
Thank you for taking care of me, 
Audrey. May the gods light your path.
...Goodbye.
