[ToggleMouthMove]...?[.....][AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Where... am I?[AN]
Last I remember, I was thinking about[N]
protecting the village from bandits...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Welcome, sir Isaac.[AN]
And "thinking" is not an option![N]
You must stop the bandits![AN]

[MidRight]
A joke is a joke, old man.[N]
And who are you, exactly?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Just call me...[....][N]
"The Grand Mysterious Tactician Priest."[AN]

[MidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
You are really confident[N]
about yourself, huh.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Now, now. They don't call me[N]
that for nothing, you know.[AN]

[MidRight]
I'm not going comment about your name.[N]
Anyways, where in the hell is this?[AN]

[MidLeft]
This is the Guide Corner.[N]
I will help you along your way here.[AN]

[MidRight]
Guide Corner...?[AN]
That means you'll give me[N]
intel here, right?[AN]

[MidLeft]
That's correct.[AN]
Let me explain some useful[N]
combat information.[AN]
We'll begin with [Red]Leadership[Red].[AN]
For each Leadership Star[N]
within your allied forces,[AN]
all of your allies will gain[N]
[Red]3% accuracy and avoidance[Red].[AN]
For the enemy, it is [Red]5%[Red] for each.[AN]
It will affect a lot on the battlefield,[N]
so make sure to pay attention.[AN]
Secondly, there's [Red]Capture[Red].[AN]
This command will appear when [Red]your[N]
constitution is higher[Red] than the enemy's.[AN]
If you can defeat the enemy,[N]
you will capture them.[AN]
By doing this you can [Red]take[N]
their items and weapons[Red].[AN]
Also, when you release the[N]
enemy, you will gain [Red]10 EXP[Red].[AN]
But, when trying to capture, [Red]your[N]
skill and speed will be halved[Red].[AN]

[MidRight]
That sounds like an[N]
important tactic.[AN]
I'll have to keep my eyes open for[N]
opportunites to make use of it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
There are some other important things[N]
to go over, but I'll cover those later.[AN]
If you get stuck, consider [Red]reading[N]
the included text[Red].[AN]

[MidRight]
That's all well and nice, but how about[N]
some advice for the current situation?[AN]

[MidLeft]
For these goons?[AN]
Most of them are just waiting for[N]
you to get close so they can jump you.[AN]
Might be a good time to practice capturing.[AN]
Actually, I think there are some bandits[N]
[Red]hiding in a house down below[Red] for you to[AN]
get to [Red]the lower half[Red] of the village.[AN]
Seems like they're ready to signal their[N]
friends to start attacking as well,[AN]
so be careful when you start to[N]
get to the south side.[AN]
Also, keep your eyes open[N]
for [Red]hidden treasures[Red].[AN]
You'll find them all over the[N]
place throughout your journey.[AN]
In fact, I think I saw[N]
something on [Red]that ship[Red]...[AN]

[MidRight]
Hidden Treasure, huh?[AN]
That sounds important.[N]
Am I going to need it?[AN]

[MidLeft]
No worries about that.[AN]
It's helpful to have,[N]
but [Red]not necessary[Red].[AN]

[MidRight]
I see. Thank you.[AN]
I'll be counting on you[N]
next time, then.[AN][X]
