To the west of Elibe, there are islands.[A][Event][N]
On the northeast is Dia.[A][Event][N]
Down to the south is Caldonia.[AN]
And between the two islands is Fibernia.[A][Event][N]
Together, these three islands are[N]
called The Western Isles.[AN]
Each island has rich mines,[N]
which are being developed actively.[AN]
The largest of the mines is Eburacum,[N]
on the northern end of Fibernia.[AN]
The Western Isles are a[N]
protectorate of Etruria.[AN]
Nobles of some areas of the three islands,[N]
as lords, govern their own territories.[AN]
In Jutes, an area among said territories,[N]
Etrurians established their administration[AN]
headquarters, and all issues on the islands[N]
are decided after Jutes has approved.[AN]
From Jutes, messengers are sent[N]
to the lords of the islands.[AN]
"Gather men from all over the islands,[N]
and mobilize them to Eburacum."[AN]
Under this message, the lords, in a hurry,[N]
gather men from all over the islands.[AN]
The enforcement is so suppressive that[N]
some of the citizens formed a "Resistance"[AN]
and for a while they have fought against[N]
the Pirates, who aim at the wealth on the[AN]
islands and the Etrurian Lords. At these[N]
islands, in such a threatening atmosphere,[AN]
arrives a group of mercenaries.[A][Event][N]
The name of their commander is Isaac.[AN]
The members of this group were originally[AN]
knights of Etruria, but an affair forced[N]
them to leave the country.[AN]
After they disappeared, they formed a group[N]
of mercenaries to make their livelihoods.[AN]
To earn their keep, they wandered[N]
about Elibe as mercenaries,[AN]
and eventually arrived at[N]
Dia of The Western Isles.[AN]
This story begins a half year later...[AN]
Isaac and the mercenaries are working[N]
as hired guards of a village.[AN]
Starting now, they are involved[N]
in a battle in The Western Isles[AN]
which was lost through history.[AN][X]
