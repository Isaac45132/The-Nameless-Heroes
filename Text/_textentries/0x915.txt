Hey, Boss![AN]
They're saying that some[N]
mercenary folk've showed up![AN]
And that O'Neill[N]
and Breguet were...[AN]

[MidRight][LoadBazba]
Killed, and they say[N]
it was these worms.[AN]
Cocky bastards...[AN]
They think they can just[N]
prance around my island?![AN]
Do they really think so[N]
highly of themselves?[AN]
This is my turf,[N]
I know the terrain.[AN]
They won't see us coming in[N]
the fog until it's too late![AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah![A][X]
