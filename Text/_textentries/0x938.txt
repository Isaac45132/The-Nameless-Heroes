Isaac, we've arranged a boat.[AN]

[MidRight]
Well, that's good.[N]
Sooner than I expected.[AN]
Although the pirates'[N]
boat was available...[AN]
There was nobody who[N]
knew how to drive it.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Most of the town's men were killed[N]
or evacuated, so very few remained.[AN]
We arranged with people on the merchant[N]
ship which happened to stop at the port.[AN]

[MidRight]
I see. Guess we[N]
got lucky.[AN]
Have you told them[N]
where we're going?[AN]
We're going to the[N]
hideout of the pirates.[AN]
Nobody would want to get[N]
involved with that.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Don't worry, Isaac. I've already told them.[AN]
They said they'll take us there,[AN]
even knowing it's the pirates' base.[N]
They were the town's favorite customers...[AN]
They don't need money from us.[N]
They say they want to support us.[AN]

[MidRight]
How generous of them. They're kind folks.[N]
Now that we've arranged a boat,[AN]
we've got nothing left but to break[N]
into the pirates' hideout, huh?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right. Those pirates made fools of us.[N]
We must make them pay dearly for that![AN][Clear]

[MidRight]
I don't mind the enthusiasm, but...[N]
try to keep your cool, Audrey.[A][X]
