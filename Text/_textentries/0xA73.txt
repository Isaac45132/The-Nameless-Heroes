Hmm? That girl looks like...?[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadRem][MoveLeft]
Hey, you! Can you[N]
get outta my way?![AN]
If you didn't notice,[AN]
I'm barely escaping[N]
with my life here![AN]

[MidRight]
My apologies. You should be[N]
able to go that way, miss.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah, thanks, bub.[AN]

[MidRight][Clear][Left][MoveFarRight][Left][LoadBrian]
Hey, little miss![N]
Hold a moment![AN]

[FarRight][Clear][LoadRem]
What is it?! Can't you[N]
see I'm in a hurry?![AN]

[Left]
I see you were holding some[N]
extravagant looking wares.[AN]
You're a thief, are you not?[AN]

[FarRight][MoveFarRight]
Hey![AN]

[MoveRight]
Those are mine![N]
Give them back![AN]

[Left]
Of course, of course.[N]
There you are, miss.[AN]

[Right][MoveRight]
Hmph![AN]

[Left]
A piece of advice,[N]
one thief to another.[AN]
Stop pickpocketing,[AN]
or you'll find yourself[N]
in an unfortunate situation.[AN]

[Right]
You, a thief, telling[N]
me to stop thieving?[AN]
You've gotta be[N]
joking with me![AN]
Where's your boss?![AN]
I've gotta complain about[N]
you, or I can't settle down![AN]
The nerve! Urgh![AN]
[Clear]

[Left]
Hey, miss! Don't go that way![AN]
You could get hurt! Hey![AN]

[FarRight]
Shut it already, fatso![A][X]
