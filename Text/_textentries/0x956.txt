Seems like the fight is over.[N]
Those Etrurians are retreating.[AN]

[Left]
We managed, but...[AN]
I didn't expect them to be committing[N]
such crimes using the mantle of authority.[AN]
What in the world is happening around here?[AN]

[MidRight]
It was definitely strange. They[N]
acted like they could do no wrong.[AN]

[MidRight][Clear][FarLeft][LoadAudrey][MidRight][LoadCaptain]
Ah, hell...[AN]
You mean ta' say[N]
you don't know?[AN]

[Left]
Captain?[N]
How is your wound?[AN]
And, do you know something[N]
about those Etrurians?[AN]

[MidRight]
My wound is far from all right...[AN]
Anyways, rumors are goin' round the isles[N]
'bout the Eburacum Mines, down on Fibernia.[AN]
Men from all over are bein' taken[N]
down there by force, as labor... slaves.[AN]
They work 'em to skin and bones, 'til[N]
they die. Least that's how the rumor goes.[AN]
People started callin' em[N]
the "Death Mines of Eburacum".[AN]

[MidRight]
Personally I thought it[N]
was a load o' hogwash...[AN]
But after seein' those[N]
men actin' like that...[AN]
I'm startin' ta change me mind.[A][X]
