Hey! Commander![AN]
Commander! Heyyy![AN]
Can you hear me!?[N]
Hell-ooo![AN]

[FarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]
...[AN]
.....[AN]
..........[OpenEyes]![AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Oh, sorry.[N]
Did you want to talk about something?[AN]

[MidRight]
Jeez![AN]
You qualifying me as a[N]
full-fledged pegasus knight,[AN]
that's what I want to talk about![AN]
You've seen, haven't you?[AN]
How I've been doing so[N]
well in battle recently?![AN]

[FarLeft]
I admit you're working hard,[N]
but I can't qualify a novice like you.[AN]

[MidRight][MoveMidRight][MidRight]
What?! Why not?![AN]
You've often complimented my skills[N]
recently, haven't you, Commander?[AN]

[FarLeft]
I only compliment you so you can do better.[N]
But you'd do well not to get carried away.[AN]

[MidRight]
Tsk...[AN]

[FarLeft]
Audrey, say something to her.[AN]

[Left][LoadAudrey]
Kara, Isaac can qualify[N]
you for a full-fledged pegasus knight[AN]
and send you back to Ilia right now.[N]
Why do you think he doesn't do that?[AN]

[MidRight]
Because he doesn't want to let me go?[AN]

[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadOlson]
She's an idiot,[N]
as always...[AN]

[MidRight]
Jeez! You're so mean![AN]

[Left]
On the battlefield, one aims[N]
at the easiest target.[AN]
Kara, if we let you back[N]
while you're still a novice,[AN]
you'll end up being[N]
killed before long.[AN]
Isaac can't help being[N]
anxious about you.[AN]
So that you aren't killed[N]
after you return to Ilia,[AN]
he wants you to leave when[N]
you are experienced enough.[AN]
Do you understand, Kara?[AN]

[FarLeft][ClearFace][LoadIsaac]
Audrey, don't say such[N]
unnecessary things.[AN]

[Left][ClearFace][LoadMorris]
Sir Commander is so thoughtful.[AN]
Kara, you are quite blessed.[AN]
When I was a new recruit, it was[ToggleMouthMove]...[N]
...?[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Hmm... It seems rather noisy[N]
outside, doesn't it?[AN]

[MidRight]
Ah! I wonder if it's an[N]
entertainer or something.[AN]
I like entertainers![N]
Hey, can I go and see?[AN]

[Left]
Wait, Kara.[AN]
Just listen to us before going.[AN]

[MidRight][CloseEyes]
Um, umm...[AN]
But you talk so long...[AN]

[FarLeft]
...That's strange.[AN]
I never heard of any[N]
events being planned.[A][X]
