Well, that was a ruckus.[AN]
Those mercenaries'll soon be[N]
cleared out, so don't worry.[AN]

[MidLeft][LoadHaltmann]
Hmph.[N]
I don't particularly care.[AN]
What I do care about is[N]
my share of half the coin.[AN]
Give it here.[AN]

[MidRight]
Alright, ya greedy bastard.[AN]
You military folk are more villanous[N]
than me, and I'm a damned pirate.[AN]

[MidLeft]
I don't need your lip.[AN]
Just do what you're[N]
ordered to do.[AN]
...[....][AN]
Excellent.[N]
Now then...[AN]

[MidRight]
Hold on! We're not finished here.[N]
Aren't you going to help me?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Help you?[N]
...Help you?[AN]
By the gods, I am[N]
not your governor.[AN]
You made your bed,[N]
now lie in it.[AN]

[MidRight]

You're the ones who[N]
ordered us to do this![AN]
Now I have to put[N]
up with it by myself?![A][X]
