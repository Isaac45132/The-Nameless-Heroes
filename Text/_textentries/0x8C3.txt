Commander![AN]
Is it really OK?[AN]
Commander! Please answer my question![AN]
Is that village really...[AN]
the hideout of the Pirates who are said[N]
to be pillaging other countries?![AN]

Commander![AN]
We haven't found any evidence,[N]
not even a trace, of their robberies![AN]
Soldiers happened to be stationed there,[N]
and they were only the lord's soldiers![AN]
And aside from them, they[N]
were just civilians...[AN]
without any experience on the[N]
battlefield, they were just...[AN]
It's that kind of people that we're killing![AN]

[MidRight]
That is the order we received.[AN]
They are enemies of the country,[N]
who are pillaging other countries.[AN]
We are not killing[N]
any unrelated civilians.[AN]
We are just fulfilling our[N]
duties as "knights".[AN]
Be careful of your words.[AN]
We mustn't let other countries know that[N]
this is the work of Etruria, at all costs.[AN]
That's why we were directly ordered[N]
by Etrurian nobles themselves.[AN]
There's no reason for[N]
doubting our orders.[AN]

[MidRight]
We go on with our mission.[AN]
Now, we must set each house on fire[N]
and leave this village.[AN]
Then, our mission is completed.[A][X]
