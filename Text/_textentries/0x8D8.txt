Sir Isaac! We have a problem![AN]

What's the problem now?[AN]

[MidRight]
While we were in that mess,[AN]
some of the young girls[N]

The neighboring town to[N]
here has the only port[AN]
with the capacity for[N]
a moderately-sized boat.[AN]
Those brigands should be[N]
planning to go out to sea[AN]
and take the girls[N]
to their hideout.[AN]

Sir Isaac, please...[....][N]
for God's sake,[AN]
help our girls...[AN]

We're leaving as[N]
soon as we're ready.[A][X]
