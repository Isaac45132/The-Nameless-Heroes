Brian, have you seen Hermes?[AN]
I wanted to check up[N]
on our supplies, but...[AN]

[MidLeft]
Oh, Hermes?[AN]
Now that you mention it,[N]
I think I saw him over the counter.[AN]
He'll show up if you call[N]
him over the counter, no?[AN]

[MidRight]
I see, thanks.[N]
I'll try that, then.[AN]

[MidLeft]
By the by, he seemed to be [N]
clenching onto something,[AN]
muttering "Looks like I can[N]
make some good money".[AN]
Until next time.[AN][Clear]

[MidRight]
What is he up to now...?[AN]
I guess I'll have to[N]
find out for myself.[AN]
He should just be[N]
over the counter.[A][X]
