Boss man! We're in trouble![AN]
I heard the guys who bumped[N]
off O'Neill are heading here![AN]
You didn't tell us we[N]
would be fighting anybody![AN]

[MidRight]
Hey now, you don't[N]
have to be afraid.[AN]
That idiot O'Neill was[N]
just taken off guard.[AN]
Those "mercenaries" can barely[N]
swing their own weapons.[AN]
Don't worry about them.[AN]
Focus on loading up the[N]
ship with goods and women.[AN]
C'mon lads, don't be[N]
afraid of those jackoffs![A][X]
