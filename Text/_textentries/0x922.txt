Commander, sorry I'm late.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Chloe, welcome back.[N]
Don't worry about it.[AN]
I'm just glad you're back safe.[AN]
What about Titor, Sofia,[N]
Berkus and Johnny?[AN]
Not that I expect[N]
them to be in danger...[AN]

[MidRight]
They got another mission...[N]
I came back alone to deliver a message.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Alright. If that's the case,[AN]
then I guess you already[N]
completed your mission.[AN]

[MidRight]
Hm. Yeah.[N]
No problems there, but...[AN]
This town looks like it's[N]
become quite a mess...[AN]

[MidLeft]
...This whole area was[N]
assaulted by the pirates.[AN]
They even attacked the[N]
village where our base is.[AN]

[MidRight]
They went that far...[N]
So, what are we going to do now?[AN]

[MidLeft]
Right now we're looking for[N]
someone to give us passage.[AN]
As soon as we find one, we'll[N]
attack the pirate's hideout.[AN]

[MidRight]
All right, I suppose I'll join you.[N]
It's always good to have more people.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Are you sure?[N]
You just returned.[AN]

[MidRight]
No need to worry about me.[N]
I've got it under control.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Thank you then, Chloe.[N]
Lend us your blade.[A][X]
