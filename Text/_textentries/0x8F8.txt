Isaac, we found the map[N]
to that isolated island.[AN]

[MidLeft]
It seems that the women were[N]
taken away to this island.[AN]
We couldn't save the people in town...[AN]
The least we can do is recue[N]
those who were kidnapped.[AN]
That is... our duty.[AN]

[MidRight]
I feel the same way, Isaac.[AN]
Let's kill those pirates,[N]
rescue those people and come home.[AN]
That would avenge those[N]
who have been killed.[AN]

[MidLeft]
Yeah...[N]
I hope so.[A][X]
