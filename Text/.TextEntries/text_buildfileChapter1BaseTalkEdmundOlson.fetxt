Hey, Olson?[AN]



[MidLeft]

Oh, Ed.[N]

You look rather cheerful.[AN]



[MidRight][ToggleSmile]

For good reason! Ta-dah![AN]

Would you like to take a[N]

break and eat these with me?[AN]



[MidLeft]

Hm? Baked goods? They[N]

look pretty expensive.[AN]

You bought them[N]

for yourself, right?[AN]

I wouldn't want to[N]

take any from you.[AN]



[MidRight]

Now now, brother.[AN]

These kinds of things are best[N]

eaten with people you care about![AN]

Please, help yourself![AN]





[MidLeft]

If you insist... maybe[N]

one or two couldn't hurt.[AN]

Heh, well, letâ€™s see here...[A][X]
