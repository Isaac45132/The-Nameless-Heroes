Hey there, commander![N]

Did I make it in time?[AN]

It's not easy to get going[N]

on such a short notice![AN]



[MidLeft]

I was wondering where[N]

you went off to, Hermes.[AN]

Is everything ready?[AN]



[MidRight]

You bet! I'm all ready to[N]

serve your item storage needs.[AN]

If you need help managing your[N]

inventory, give me a call.[AN]



[MidLeft]

Don't let me[N]

down, Hermes.[A][2X][X]
