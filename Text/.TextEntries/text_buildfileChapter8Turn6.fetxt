Pathetic. How long does it[N]

take to wipe these scum out?![AN]



[MidLeft]

M-my apologies sir...[AN]

The enemy's counterattack[N]

was stronger than expected.[AN]



[MidRight]

Having trouble with them[N]

is most disappointing.[AN]

The cavalry reserves[N]

will be here before long.[AN]

When they arrive, crush[N]

them in one fell swoop.[AN]

Do I make myself clear?[AN]



[MidLeft]

Yes sir.[N]

Without fail.[A][X]
