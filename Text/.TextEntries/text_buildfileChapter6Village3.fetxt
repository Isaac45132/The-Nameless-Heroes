[MidRight][LoadCurrent][MidLeft][LoadOldMan]

In my youth, I was a knight of some[N]

renown, I'll have you know.[AN]

I've even crossed blades with one of[N]

Etruria's most famous generals, I have.[AN]

Ah, but I'm an old man now...[AN]

I'm starting to worry... What if I die[N]

without passing on my techniques?[AN]

So I decided to write down what I've[N]

learned in a book. I have it here.[AN]

You seem like a strong warrior. I'd[N]

be honored if you would accept it.[A][X]
