This is the "Support[N]

Consultation Office"...[AN]

but you seem to like[N]

being by yourself.[AN]

However, by having[N]

relationships with people,[AN]

you can gain various[N]

things, in my opinion.[AN]

If you build a[N]

relationship with someone,[AN]

and overcome[N]

hardships with them...[AN]

Then, you are welcome[N]

to come and see me.[AN]

I'm certain that I'll[N]

be of service to you.[A][X]
